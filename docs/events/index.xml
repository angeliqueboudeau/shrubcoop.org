      <description>Come and work on a crafty project in the company of some lovely folks. Make a brew and pop in for some nice company. Great if you do have a project on the go but not at all essential - we can also help you to start something new!
When: Every Tuesday evening at 5.30-7pm. Please try and join before 5.40pm so our lovely volunteer Mary isn&amp;rsquo;t waiting too long.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ll watch the film together and then have a chat about what we think and what actions we feel motivated to take going forward.</description>

Join us on Zoom from 7:45pm to meet up and chat with other SHRUB members in breakout rooms, then from 8-10pm there will be live music and dancing that you can join in with from home.</description>

      <description>Carrying stuff while cycling! Sometimes it can be hard to know where to find information and resources about cycling, and not everyone knows someone they can ask…but what if there was a place you could go to meet other “everyday cyclists” to ask all those questions? Well, we’ve created a space to do just that! We are welcoming new and everyday cyclists to join us in a fortnightly skill-share where we can help you find the information you need to get where you want to go on two wheels!</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
We have been running our Sustainable Fashion Working Group for quite a while now and thought now would be a good time to re-think how we want this group to run and what we want its aims and purpose to be in the new year.
This has always been a group for exploring topics around the environmental and social impact of the fashion and textiles industry but now that there is a lot more information about this in the news, maybe it is time for the focus of the group to shift.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re headed out of the city to travel for Christmas or are looking to clear some space, we have just the solution for you - we will take your unwanted items! We will make sure they are COVID free and give them back out to the community next year in a wonderful Freeshop.
As we want to give the items away so someone else can get use from them, we do ask that everything is in usable / wearable condition.</description>
