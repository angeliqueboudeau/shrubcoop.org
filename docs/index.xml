      <description>The Food Sharing Hub is Scotland’s first rescued food shop and exists to save surplus food from supermarkets from an unnecessary fate in the bin.
It&amp;rsquo;s open for everyone. Simply come along to the Food Sharing Hub. Fill a basket with food and pay as you feel.
How it works The Food Sharing Hub is working with Tesco, Co-op and Waitrose to collect food from 6 local supermarkets. Volunteers collect perishable foods such as fruit, vegetables, and baked goods that are still fresh and good to eat, but have passed their best before dates and would otherwise be thrown out that day.</description>

      <description>STOP PLASTIC POLLUTION IN OUR OCEANS : WHY RECYCLING IS NOT THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION
More and more plastic debris ends up in our oceans every single day. I was recently shocked to learn that over 300 million tonnes of plastic items are being produced on average per year and by 2050, with the global population expanding, this production is likely to be tripled! This will lead us to approximately 900 million tonnes of plastic produced per year.</description>

      <title>A Less-Than-Cheerful Assessment of the Fashion Industry (Part I)</title>
      <link>https://www.shrubcoop.org/a-less-than-cheerful-assessment-of-the-fashion-industry-part-i/</link>

      <description>First, before saying anything else: There are no ‘sustainable’ clothes that will improve the state of the world, every purchase is connected to an extraction of resources from this planet. So what can we do to reduce the damage we cause effectively when looking for clothes that we either want or need?
The big problem with fashion is the amount of clothing already existing and still being made. Every additional piece produced is unnecessary in terms of fighting climate change and reducing resource depletion.</description>

      <description>Advertisement for male corsets, proving no fashion item is naturally gendered.

Corsets, high heels and makeup - men wore them first.
Fashion is often identified as a tool of self-expression, yet for centuries, this freedom of expression has been limited by the gendering of clothing. This manifests itself not only in the colours we wear (pink is for girls, blue is for boys), but in many cases, the items and styles designed for men and women can impact our behaviour in society through the reinforcement of gender stereotypes.</description>

      <description>WEE SPOKE HUB
The Wee Spoke Hub is a project of SHRUB Cooperative.
We have been funded since around 2014 to provide a space and time for people to learn how to maintain their bikes, a distinctly non-sexist, supportive community advocating for sustainable active travel modes in and around south central Edinburgh. Our last lot of funding ran till March 2020 when the global Coronavirus Pandemic closed lots of community-led initiatives down.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to see so many people embracing cycling as a way of getting around recently. Cycling has a bit of a reputation in the UK for being the reserve of sports enthusiasts, wearing the distinctive lycra outfits that we see on TV in sports events. However, in other parts of the world cycling is much more part of the day-to-day fabric of life - just another transport option that can be much cheaper and more convenient than public transport or a private car.</description>

      <description>A quick introduction about myself. Born and bred in Brisbane, Australia I unknowingly moved to Edinburgh weeks before the pandemic hit. With a Bachelor of Design and a Graduate Certificate in Science (Environment and Sustainability) my aim was to continue into a job that tickled my passion for sustainability, community and creativity. Covid-19 thought I was overreaching with simply wanting a job but luckily I came by part time work and I found Shrub, an outlet for my passions, a community to be a part of, and a space to (hopefully) make a difference.</description>

      <description>With Oatly’s recent announcement of a 10% buyout by the Blackstone Group we thought it was time to have a bit of a deeper dive into some of our suppliers. This has led to several rabbit holes with some unpleasant surprises down them. It’s almost like there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism, funny that.
As a cafe we need an oat milk that tastes good, foams well and is easily available.</description>

      <description>For many of us, lockdown is a completely alien experience, unlike anything we’ve ever experienced before. It’s a difficult time - not being able to see our loved ones, many of us not being able to go to work, or no longer having a job at all. I for one know how easy it can be in these circumstances to let your wellbeing slide. However, that makes it all the more important to look after our mental health, as well as physical.</description>

      <guid>https://www.shrubcoop.org/we-re-trialing-a-new-steering-group/</guid>
      <description>What is it? As a growing community-led social enterprise, SHRUB Coop needs a transparent, and effective decision-making process. As we&amp;rsquo;ve grown over the past two years, collective decision making has at times been difficult and slow.
To address this, we are trialing a steering group of members, volunteers, staff, and trustees to replace the Member&amp;rsquo;s Decision Making Meetings for 3 months. This group will oversee short to medium-term strategy for the organisation and contribute to day to day decision making.</description>

      <description>We often hear about how the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world, but how can you go about making your own fashion choices more sustainable?
A wardrobe audit will help you to recycle clothes you don&amp;rsquo;t want anymore, free up space for those that you actually need, and rediscover those you’d forgotten about at the back of a draw. Thankfully, Jo from the Swapshop is here to guide you through how to do your own, step by step.</description>

      <description>Over the past 2 years, we&amp;rsquo;ve been tackling climate change on a community level by reducing waste and consumption practices in Edinburgh. SHRUB has come a long way in this time and we hope to go much further with renewed funding for a further 2 years to run our Swapshop, events and workshops, and the annual End of Term Collections from student halls.
Many people across the city now know SHRUB as the vibrant and immersive community to talk about and find new innovative ideas to tackle the ecological crisis together.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been awarded another 2 years of funding through the Climate Challenge Fund! This is a very important first step for our funding strategy going forward and its the result of a huge amount of hard work from our funding team. Thank you to everyone involved.
During the summer in 2019, we undertook a community consultation to find out what you as members wanted the cooperative to focus on over the next few years.</description>

      <description>Since 2013 we have&amp;hellip;  Saved over 1,700 tonnes of carbon from being added to the atmosphere. That&amp;rsquo;s the equivalent of 11,000 flights from Edinburgh to London Supported hundreds of volunteers to gain new skills and confidence Educated thousands of people in Edinburgh to repair and reuse things instead of needlessly throwing them away Created a special community and friendships that will last a lifetime  As a charity, we rely on grants and fundraising to keep going.</description>

      <description>In order to do our part in ‘flattening the curve’ of COVID-19, and in accordance with government advice to halt all non-essential activity, SHRUB Coop will temporarily close all public activities until further notice.
With heavy hearts, this decision was made in a meeting between staff and trustees to ensure the safety of our volunteers and vulnerable members of the public.
We understand the difficulties this will cause to those who rely on our services, and to our volunteers who gain valuable social contact by taking part in our activities.</description>

We’ll now, hopefully, be able to work with all other groups and individuals at SHRUB to promote the health and wellbeing of all members, staff, and volunteers.</description>

This time we only get 10 responses (we can do better than that next time!) but they were priceless.
1. There are clear positive behavioral changes from being a member. 40% of you reported you throw away less food.</description>

      <description>“Out with the old and in with the new” is the mantra that crops up at this time of year, but this optimistic phrase is deceptively damaging to our world. Wardrobe revamps have become part of the regenerative symbol of spring, leaving a trail of poisonous dyes and discarded fabrics behind them.
The clothing industry has a huge carbon footprint – it takes around 8000 litres of water to produce just one pair of blue jeans.</description>

      <description>Did you know that almost a third of all food produced globally is thrown away? In Edinburgh alone, more than 27 tonnes of edible food are thrown out every week – that’s equivalent to 54,000 meals.
Some of this wasted food is thrown out by households and individuals: you can find advice on reducing your own food waste footprint from Love Food, Hate Waste among others.
Most of it, however, is thrown away by supermarkets who are cannot sell perfectly edible food after its ‘Best Before’ date.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
We have been running our Sustainable Fashion Working Group for quite a while now and thought now would be a good time to re-think how we want this group to run and what we want its aims and purpose to be in the new year.
This has always been a group for exploring topics around the environmental and social impact of the fashion and textiles industry but now that there is a lot more information about this in the news, maybe it is time for the focus of the group to shift.</description>

As we want to give the items away so someone else can get use from them, we do ask that everything is in usable / wearable condition.</description>
