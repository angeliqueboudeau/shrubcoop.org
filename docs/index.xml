      <description>We are an Edinburgh-based bike shop with a difference!
We are currently part of the Scotland Cycle Repair Scheme!
This is providing free repairs and maintenance to people who need it most, to get thousands of people across the country on their bikes.
It’s funded by Transport Scotland and administered by Cycling UK to provide free repairs up to the value of £50.
The coronavirus crisis has hit many people hard, so we know it can be difficult to pay for essential bike repairs.</description>

      <description>Each year, one-third of all food produced for human consumption worldwide goes to waste. This is approximately 1.3 billion tonnes. (FAO, 2019). In central Edinburgh, 27.1 tonnes of food goes to waste every week - that&amp;rsquo;s the equivalent of roughly 54,000 meals unnecessarily thrown in the bin (Zero Waste Edinburgh, 2017).
The Food Sharing Hub, located in our Zero Waste Hub at 22 Bread Street, is Scotland’s first rescued food shop and exists to save surplus food from supermarkets and small businesses around Edinburgh from an unnecessary fate in the bin.</description>

      <description>You could always get your loved ones a Shrub Coop Giftcard (pictured above) to celebrate the season and introduce new people to zero waste living!
Welcome to the festive season, a time of decorating, gift-giving, and mild overindulgence in food, all in the company of our nearest and dearest. Whatever occasion is being celebrated during the winter period, one need only look towards the high street to see the thronging crowds purchasing anything and everything that adorns the festive windows.</description>

      <description>Santa Beaver Christmas tree decorations made with fabric from Shrub Coop.
With Christmas drawing nearer, the pressure to shop is steadily growing. This year, instead of adding to the mountains of unwanted gifts that will end up in charity shops or landfill before the end of January, why not get creative and upcycle some textile gifts?
Some of the following ideas require a bit of sewing know-how but others can be completed without a needle and thread!</description>

      <description>Just some examples of the various certifications that brands pursue to reassure consumers that their products meet certain standards. Image source here.
Sustainable. Vegan. Organic. Fairtrade. Ethical. You name the buzzword, there’s a little badge or sticker attached to a product to indicate that the brand meets this standard. According to multiple studies, including this recent Deloitte survey, consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of their ‘buying power’: the ability to enact political decisions through their consumption habits.</description>

After being rescheduled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 26th Conference of the Parties, or COP26, has begun in the host city of Glasgow. Hundreds of state representatives from every region of the world will be in attendance to discuss the next steps necessary to take against climate change, with activists and experts from across the globe equally travelling to voice their concerns and demands for more effective climate action.</description>

      <title>Microplastics: Where Are They Now?</title>

      <description>There was a brief period where the term ‘microplastics’ was as ubiquitous as plastic itself is. A time when scientists and consumers alike were alarmed by the reports of plastic in our fish stocks and our drinking water, with one report even finding traces of microplastics in unborn babies. However, just as this health and environmental hazard was beginning to attract serious attention from the media and public, the COVID-19 pandemic overshadowed it, and microplastics skirted backwards into the corners of public consciousness.</description>

      <description>Our dedicated volunteer, Deirdre, sorting through some of the books we have been donated.
Every September, Oxfam launches its Secondhand September campaign, which challenges consumers not to buy any new clothing for the thirty days of the month. This campaign began as a means to raise awareness of the environmental impact of fast fashion. Throughout September, Oxfam encourages consumers to donate their unwanted clothing to the charity and to buy secondhand fashion from Oxfam (and other charity) shops.</description>

      <description>One of our own volunteers, Mary, leading Shrub’s ‘Stitch it, don’t ditch it’ sessions - using sewing as a means to fight the fast fashion industry.
In an era of endless ‘-isms’, it is possible that some people may have (dis)missed the rise of craftivism for lack of clarity or understanding, but this is an ‘-ism’ worth becoming acquainted with. Craftivism is a form of activism channelled through crafting, and craftivists are called to use their crafting abilities to help the greater good.</description>

Like it or not, however much we’re aware of our impact as consumers, it’s almost impossible to live life without occasionally buying something. While we should all now be aware of the fashion industry’s contribution to climate change, we do still need to wear (and therefore sometimes buy) clothes.
But knowing about the causes of climate change and being aware of our consumer power comes with great responsibility – when you need new pants/socks/trousers/shoes, how do you make the most ethical choice?</description>

Every July, millions of participants from around the globe commit to eliminating plastic from their lives as part of Plastic Free July. This movement aims to encourage people to reduce their plastic consumption and thus, their plastic pollution, as participants are challenged to adopt more environmentally-friendly substitutes and alternatives in the fight against climate change. The challenge is harder than one would think. From takeaway coffees to soaps containing microplastics, plastic is practically part of our cultural landscape - and it’s one of the biggest destroyers of our natural landscape.</description>

So you’re standing at your bins with an empty pizza box in hand wondering where to put it. The box is made of cardboard, and cardboard is recyclable, so surely that means the box should go in the recycling bin? Okay, there’s a bit of grease on the bottom of the box, but what harm can that do? Worse comes to worst, someone will remove the box from the cardboard recycling pile, but at least you did your part.</description>

Continuing our examination into the dynamics of discrimination prevalent in the fashion industry, this week we want to look at the promotion of ableism that obscures disabled people from the gaze of designers and consumers alike. In the UK alone, 1 in 5 people have a disability of some form 1 in 5 people have a disability of some form (according to data from 2019), and yet there is limited representation in fashion for this large portion of our population.</description>

Of all the objects forbidden to women in the past, the bicycle remains one of the most mysterious (and perhaps absurd) items that men removed from their reach. Was it assumed that women would pedal away from their husbands, abandoning family and home?</description>

      <description>In many nations across the world, June is marked as Pride Month; a month celebrating LGBTQ+ culture and history. Pride Month commemorates the Stonewall uprising in 1969 when a number of LGBTQ+ activists protested the police raids on a gay bar in New York. This uprising proved the necessary catalyst for societies to recognise the injustices enacted against this community, and in the years since then, countries such as the UK have made significant progress in promoting equal and more inclusive societies.</description>

Realised that the perfect option doesn’t exist and wondered how hard it would be to make your own from an old t-shirt? I have (I even have a sewing pattern and all of the pieces cut out), and from the conversations I have had with other people, it sounds like I am not the only one.</description>

      <description>At Shrub Coop, we regularly promote our Swap Shop and Depop as a great place to find more eco-friendly clothing gems that you can wear and cherish for years to come. We strongly believe that sustainable fashion should be promoted and adopted by as many people as possible, but like many other industries, sustainable fashion can sometimes be exclusionary and daunting for many people. One of the biggest gaps in the sustainable fashion industry is the lack of plus-sized clothing available in charity shops or at online second-hand retailers.</description>

      <description>As a child we’ve all either handed something on (or down!) or been the recipient of a hand-me-down item ourselves – continuing the useful life of the garment and saving families some money in the process.
One thing that can’t be denied about children is that they keep growing, and a lot of the time their clothes are far from worn out by the time they are outgrown. It makes good sense to pass them on to someone who is the right size to make use of them.</description>

While we have previously looked at some of the common concerns around cycling in cities, this National Bike Month we want to focus on how cycling can be used to mobilise politicians to commit to greater environmental action.</description>

Based on UK Government statistics, it is likely that over 400 000 tonnes of used/second-hand textiles are exported each year. They are sent abroad, labelled as aid and sold on in textile markets for very low prices.
Are foreign textile markets not a good thing?
At first, foriegn textile markets sound like a great idea. We are sending clothes to countries where they will be reused and told that they go to people who may not otherwise be able to buy their own clothes.</description>

      <description>Photo: The theme for Earth Day this year is ‘Restore our Earth’.
COVID-19 has been a hard time for all of us, and there’s no doubt we are excited to see vaccination numbers rise and restrictions begin to ease. The promise of a ‘return to normalcy’ is alluring. There is a comfort in the familiar. But a return to normalcy is not what the world needs now. Instead, the world needs transformation, and this Earth Day, we are focusing on how to Restore our Earth.</description>

      <description>‘Revolution, but make it fashion’ - 2021 slogan.
Infographic: Fashion Revolution.
It can be overwhelming learning about all the atrocities that the fashion industry involves. One need only read our recent article series ‘A Less-Than-Cheerful Assessment of the Fashion Industry’ (Part I and Part II) to understand just how many issues the fashion industry is hiding behind its glamorous catwalks. However, Fashion Revolution is not in the business of shaming individuals in the pursuit of systemic change.</description>

      <description>What is the need for Textile Recycling?
As you may have seen in our recent blog posts, there is a massive problem with there being too many textiles in the world and many, many issues with how they are produced. According to the CBI (the Confederation of British Industry) there is a loss of approximately $100 billion of materials per year. With these issues in mind, something needs to change. Much has been said about the role of rewearing, repairing, reselling and repurposing your old clothing, but what happens when your stockings get the inevitable run?</description>

On April 24th 2013, the hidden realities of the fast fashion industry came to light when 1,138 garment workers were killed in the worst industrial disaster ever witnessed in Bangladesh. Rana Plaza, located outside the capital city of Dhaka, was home to five clothing factories making clothes for fast fashion brands including Primark, Benetton and Walmart. When workers arrived that morning, many refused to go in when they saw the cracks in the building, yet managers insisted they enter the building.</description>

      <description>It is difficult to concisely express and divide up the main problems in fashion. Let me name five big ones that cannot be looked past. All these issues overlap and sometimes contribute to each other. The topics are listed in no particular order as all of these are important.
Global systemic racism and the connection to slavery
Like all industries and institutions, the fashion system operates within the boundaries of the global trade system often based on colonialist trade routes and hierarchies upholding to this day neo-colonial rule.</description>

      <description>The Easter Bunny is a tradition enacted in homes across the UK every year.
Image: https://www.sootoday.com/local-news/easter-bunny-allowed-to-make-home-visits-this-year-declares-ontario-premier-2236472
The celebration of Easter, whether religious or otherwise, solidifies the arrival of Spring, signalling longer and warmer days ahead, and bringing a welcome four day Bank Holiday. However, this celebration also carries huge amounts of food waste, improper recycling and another weekend of indulging the habits of overconsumption that are driving climate destruction.
Food waste is a large contributor to greenhouse emissions (representing approximately 8% of global emissions), and this year, it is predicted that there will be 8,490 tonnes of food thrown away in the UK over the Easter weekend alone.</description>

      <description>What happens when you donate to charity shops?
When we think of donating to charity shops, we often think we are doing our bit to help the planet. We are making sure that our old clothes are being reused, and we are often buying second hand as well.
The network of charity shops that we have across the country in most towns and villages is amazing, however it isn’t perfect.</description>

This Saturday March 27th 2021, millions of people will turn off their lights between 8.30pm and 9.30pm local time as part of WWF’s annual ‘Earth Hour’ campaign.
Now in its fourteenth year, Earth Hour was introduced as a worldwide hour of action to draw attention to the need for definitive action on climate and biodiversity issues.</description>

As soon as you went into the back of the shop, there were boxes and bags of things everywhere. Bags of donations to be sorted, boxes of priced clothes to take to the store room, huge bags of clothes waiting to be taken to reuse partners.</description>

● If you could name one woman that has had a significant impact on your life, who would that be and why her specifically?
● Do you have any books, TV shows, podcasts, documentaries to recommend about Feminism and the fight for Women&amp;rsquo;s rights?</description>

      <description>Women are described as being more in touch with nature, made explicit in this depiction of ‘Mother Nature’.
The intersection of feminism and climate justice is talked about a lot in the media, but the promotion of ‘feminist solutions’ to the climate crisis undermines the obstacles that women are faced with every day.
International Women’s Day rolls around once more as society takes stock of how much (or little) progress has been made in promoting gender equality and dismantling the patriarchy.</description>

      <description>Pre-loved books on display at Shrub Coop.
Reading is one of those experiences that is both highly personal and yet also a source of community. Reading can challenge our perspectives and drive our imaginations. It can provide us with an escape or ground us in reality. Entire worlds are opened through the words of a page, and with these worlds, new conversations. So many of us connect with others through reading, explicitly or subconsciously.</description>

      <description>The aim of this guide is to help you set up a swap shop in an already existing community space.
A swap shop can be a great way of bringing a community together as it encourages swapping between people within the community. It can be really nice when you find something new, to hear about the story of where it came from, and it can often be easier to part with things if you know where they are going.</description>

Too often, the climate crisis is portrayed in a way that seems detached from our lived realities; represented by numbers and statistics or discussed in scientific, technical language that can make us feel alienated from what’s going on.</description>

      <description>STOP PLASTIC POLLUTION IN OUR OCEANS : WHY RECYCLING IS NOT THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION
More and more plastic debris ends up in our oceans every single day. I was recently shocked to learn that over 300 million tonnes of plastic items are being produced on average per year and by 2050, with the global population expanding, this production is likely to be tripled! This will lead us to approximately 900 million tonnes of plastic produced per year.</description>

      <description>First, before saying anything else: There are no ‘sustainable’ clothes that will improve the state of the world, every purchase is connected to an extraction of resources from this planet. So what can we do to reduce the damage we cause effectively when looking for clothes that we either want or need?
The big problem with fashion is the amount of clothing already existing and still being made. Every additional piece produced is unnecessary in terms of fighting climate change and reducing resource depletion.</description>

Corsets, high heels and makeup - men wore them first.
Fashion is often identified as a tool of self-expression, yet for centuries, this freedom of expression has been limited by the gendering of clothing. This manifests itself not only in the colours we wear (pink is for girls, blue is for boys), but in many cases, the items and styles designed for men and women can impact our behaviour in society through the reinforcement of gender stereotypes.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to see so many people embracing cycling as a way of getting around recently. Cycling has a bit of a reputation in the UK for being the reserve of sports enthusiasts, wearing the distinctive lycra outfits that we see on TV in sports events. However, in other parts of the world cycling is much more part of the day-to-day fabric of life - just another transport option that can be much cheaper and more convenient than public transport or a private car.</description>

      <description>A quick introduction about myself. Born and bred in Brisbane, Australia I unknowingly moved to Edinburgh weeks before the pandemic hit. With a Bachelor of Design and a Graduate Certificate in Science (Environment and Sustainability) my aim was to continue into a job that tickled my passion for sustainability, community and creativity. Covid-19 thought I was overreaching with simply wanting a job but luckily I came by part time work and I found Shrub, an outlet for my passions, a community to be a part of, and a space to (hopefully) make a difference.</description>

      <title>The Great Oat Milk Debate!</title>

      <guid>https://www.shrubcoop.org/the-great-oat-milk-debate/</guid>
      <description>With Oatly’s recent announcement of a 10% buyout by the Blackstone Group we thought it was time to have a bit of a deeper dive into some of our suppliers. This has led to several rabbit holes with some unpleasant surprises down them. It’s almost like there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism, funny that.
As a cafe we need an oat milk that tastes good, foams well and is easily available.</description>

      <description>For many of us, lockdown is a completely alien experience, unlike anything we’ve ever experienced before. It’s a difficult time - not being able to see our loved ones, many of us not being able to go to work, or no longer having a job at all. I for one know how easy it can be in these circumstances to let your wellbeing slide. However, that makes it all the more important to look after our mental health, as well as physical.</description>

      <guid>https://www.shrubcoop.org/we-re-trialing-a-new-steering-group/</guid>
      <description>What is it? As a growing community-led social enterprise, SHRUB Coop needs a transparent, and effective decision-making process. As we&amp;rsquo;ve grown over the past two years, collective decision making has at times been difficult and slow.
To address this, we are trialing a steering group of members, volunteers, staff, and trustees to replace the Member&amp;rsquo;s Decision Making Meetings for 3 months. This group will oversee short to medium-term strategy for the organisation and contribute to day to day decision making.</description>

      <description>We often hear about how the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world, but how can you go about making your own fashion choices more sustainable?
A wardrobe audit will help you to recycle clothes you don&amp;rsquo;t want anymore, free up space for those that you actually need, and rediscover those you’d forgotten about at the back of a draw. Thankfully, Jo from the Swapshop is here to guide you through how to do your own, step by step.</description>

      <description>Over the past 2 years, we&amp;rsquo;ve been tackling climate change on a community level by reducing waste and consumption practices in Edinburgh. SHRUB has come a long way in this time and we hope to go much further with renewed funding for a further 2 years to run our Swapshop, events and workshops, and the annual End of Term Collections from student halls.
Many people across the city now know SHRUB as the vibrant and immersive community to talk about and find new innovative ideas to tackle the ecological crisis together.</description>

      <description>In order to do our part in ‘flattening the curve’ of COVID-19, and in accordance with government advice to halt all non-essential activity, SHRUB Coop will temporarily close all public activities until further notice.
With heavy hearts, this decision was made in a meeting between staff and trustees to ensure the safety of our volunteers and vulnerable members of the public.
We understand the difficulties this will cause to those who rely on our services, and to our volunteers who gain valuable social contact by taking part in our activities.</description>

We’ll now, hopefully, be able to work with all other groups and individuals at SHRUB to promote the health and wellbeing of all members, staff, and volunteers.</description>

      <description>We care about our SHRUB community, which is why every three months the Monitoring and Evaluation group asks to hear your concerns, ideas and suggestions through our Quarterly Member Survey. This time we only get 10 responses (we can do better than that next time!) but they were priceless.
1. There are clear positive behavioral changes from being a member. 40% of you reported you throw away less food.</description>

      <description>“Out with the old and in with the new” is the mantra that crops up at this time of year, but this optimistic phrase is deceptively damaging to our world. Wardrobe revamps have become part of the regenerative symbol of spring, leaving a trail of poisonous dyes and discarded fabrics behind them.
The clothing industry has a huge carbon footprint – it takes around 8000 litres of water to produce just one pair of blue jeans.</description>

      <description>Did you know that almost a third of all food produced globally is thrown away? In Edinburgh alone, more than 27 tonnes of edible food are thrown out every week – that’s equivalent to 54,000 meals.
Some of this wasted food is thrown out by households and individuals: you can find advice on reducing your own food waste footprint from Love Food, Hate Waste among others.
Most of it, however, is thrown away by supermarkets who are cannot sell perfectly edible food after its ‘Best Before’ date.</description>

Join us on Zoom from 7:45pm to meet up and chat with other SHRUB members in breakout rooms, then from 8-10pm there will be live music and dancing that you can join in with from home.</description>

Well, we’ve created a space to do just that! We are welcoming new and everyday cyclists to join us in a fortnightly skill-share where we can help you find the information you need to get where you want to go on two wheels!</description>

This event will also include a presentation of the booklet from some of our sustainable fashion team and a fun quiz in breakout rooms.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t be scared, this is just a chance for us all to hear about what we have been up to and think about what we want to be doing in the future. It&amp;rsquo;s also time to say goodbye to our current trustees and elect new trustees for the next year ahead
We will have space for everyone to share their opinions, thoughts and ideas. Put your thinking caps on before the day and bring any ideas or questions you might have.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
We have been running our Sustainable Fashion Working Group for quite a while now and thought now would be a good time to re-think how we want this group to run and what we want its aims and purpose to be in the new year.
This has always been a group for exploring topics around the environmental and social impact of the fashion and textiles industry but now that there is a lot more information about this in the news, maybe it is time for the focus of the group to shift.</description>
