Photo: Munir Uz Zaman\/AFP\/Getty Images.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOn April 24th 2013, the hidden realities of the fast fashion industry came to light when 1,138 garment workers were killed in the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2013\/jun\/06\/bangladesh-factory-building-collapse-community\x22\x3eworst industrial disaster\x3c\/a\x3e ever witnessed in Bangladesh. Rana Plaza, located outside the capital city of Dhaka, was home to five clothing factories making clothes for fast fashion brands including Primark, Benetton and Walmart. When workers arrived that morning, many refused to go in when they saw the cracks in the building, yet \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/global-development\/2018\/apr\/24\/bangladeshi-police-target-garment-workers-union-rana-plaza-five-years-on\x22\x3emanagers insisted they enter the building.\x3c\/a\x3e In the space of ninety seconds, the entire plaza crumbled to the ground.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fashionrevolution.org\/about\/\x22\x3eFashion Revolution\x3c\/a\x3e was founded after this deadly disaster to bring together activists across the globe who are demanding greater human rights protection, environmental awareness and improved accountability and transparency within the fashion industry. Every year, Fashion Revolution week occurs to mark the anniversary of the Rana Plaza collapse and renew efforts to improve the standards of the fashion industry. The movement focuses on raising awareness of the injustices occurring in global fashion, with the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes used to encourage consumers to consider the human cost of their clothing. When production takes place so far removed from the shores where the clothes are purchased, it is easy to feel disconnected from those involved in the garment industry, but Fashion Revolution week aims to bridge that divide and unite both consumers and workers in demanding justice within the fashion industry.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWith its focus on mobilising members of society to demand higher standards of fast fashion companies, Fashion Revolution has been instrumental in bringing about positive changes such as greater transparency practices amongst fashion brands. Every year, more and more companies are agreeing to share their suppliers and factories so that consumers know how and where their clothing was made. Dividing their work into three main sections, Fashion Revolution is engaged in advocating for industry change, policy change and cultural change. These three distinct areas target concerns around the environmental cost of fashion, the improvement of workers‚Äô rights in the garment industry, and a change in consumer habits towards fashion. By consuming less fast fashion and preserving the clothing we own for longer, we can actively challenge the fashion industry and reduce our environmental impact. At Shrub, we are marking Fashion Revolution Week by sharing \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/shrubcoop\x22\x3esocial media\x3c\/a\x3e and \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/news\/\x22\x3eblog posts\x3c\/a\x3e giving you more information about the fast fashion industry and how you can avoid it. Fast fashion thrives on the constant renewal of our wardrobes, chasing the latest designs and disposing of our clothing in less-than-sustainable manners. This is driving the crises in the fashion industry, but Fashion Revolution Week provides a way for us to reconsider our relationship with our clothes and demand meaningful change in the fashion industry.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

One need only read our articles ‚ÄòA Less-Than-Cheerful Assessment of the Fashion Industry‚Äô (\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/a-less-than-cheerful-assessment-of-the-fashion-industry-part-i\/\x22\x3ePart I \x3c\/a\x3eand \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/a-less-than-cheerful-assessment-of-the-fashion-industry-part-ii-2\/\x22\x3ePart II\x3c\/a\x3e) to understand just how many issues the fashion industry is hiding behind its glamorous catwalks. However, Fashion Revolution is not in the business of shaming individuals in the pursuit of systemic change. Instead, the focus is on educating people on how to change their attitudes towards fashion and encouraging everyone to demand higher standards from fashion conglomerates. So how do we stay optimistic and stylish at the same time?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe Fashion Revolution website offers a number of different ways to engage in fashion activism. Given that the industry carries a number of concerns, from human rights, and \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/thegreenhubonline.com\/2018\/10\/21\/why-the-fast-fashion-industry-is-a-feminist-issue\/\x22\x3ewomen‚Äôs rights in particular\x3c\/a\x3e, to environmental violations and unsustainable resource use, the two hashtags #WhoMadeMyClothes and #WhatsInMyClothes challenge fashion brands to be transparent about how their products are designed and manufactured. This in turn encourages them to address the exploitative practices in their supply chain and contributes to the fight for change in the industry where brands respond to consumer demands.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe hashtag #WhoMadeMyFabric is also presented as a means to promote justice across all areas of the supply chain, not just in the manufacturing stage. Before work begins in the garment factories, a \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.the-sustainable-fashion-collective.com\/2017\/02\/27\/environmental-ethical-issues-production-natural-fabrics-fibres\/\x22\x3elitany of environmental abuses have occurred \x3c\/a\x3ein the production of fabrics, and in many cases, the farmers growing these resources are \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fairtrade.org.uk\/Farmers-and-Workers\/Cotton\/About-Cotton\/\x22\x3enot paid a fair price\x3c\/a\x3e for their labour. During Fashion Revolution Week, social media is an important tool to spotlight these issues and mobilise people across the globe to consider the implications of how their clothes were made.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFashion Revolution also encourages consumers to get in touch with brands directly, either through social media message channels, or writing an email, in order to ask questions about the policies in place to protect workers and the environment. As the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/bylinetimes.com\/2020\/07\/14\/modern-slavery-is-never-out-of-fashion-child-labour-in-the-clothing-industry\/\x22\x3esecond most at-risk industry for modern slavery\x3c\/a\x3e, it is again the pressure from consumers that can hold companies accountable for their complicity in unsafe and unjust business practices and usher in reform.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThere will be a number of educational events hosted during Fashion Revolution Week too, with the schedule available \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fashionrevolution.org\/events\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e. These events will take place all over the world, spotlighting different issues and workshopping potential solutions to the crises of the fashion industry. The \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fashionopenstudio.com\x22\x3eFashion Open Studio \x3c\/a\x3eis also a great chance to see the innovation occurring from within the industry itself, connecting consumers with designers and providing unique insight into the potential for transformation in fashion.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOf course, fashion activism is not an isolated movement that ends at the end of Fashion Revolution Week. These questions and actions are meaningful forms to engage in collective action, but we have the chance to carry these lessons through to our everyday lives too. By quitting fast fashion, or at least dramatically reducing our reliance on it, we can help to fight human rights injustices and reduce our environmental impact, and there are numerous tools out there to help with this transition. Focusing on keeping our clothes for longer helps to eliminate textile waste going to landfill, and shopping secondhand, renting clothing or just swapping with friends and family means that less resources are required to shake up our wardrobes, further protecting the environment. Here at Shrub Coop, we‚Äôre here to help you on this journey. You can find a great selection of clothing available in our Swapshop or through our \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.depop.com\/shrubcoop\/\x22\x3eDepop\x3c\/a\x3e and \x3ca href=\x22http:\/\/www.ebay.co.uk\/usr\/shrub_coop\x22\x3eeBay,\x3c\/a\x3e from jackets and jumpers to shoes and handbags. And if you find yourself growing tired of one of your old favourite items, instead of throwing it into landfill or donating it to a clothes bank (where it will likely be \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/downcycle\x22\x3edowncycled\x3c\/a\x3e), you can bring it into us and we‚Äôll help find your clothing a new loving home. For Fashion Revolution Week and beyond, we can prove that a more ethical fashion industry will never go out of style.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eResources to learn more about quitting fast fashion:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/fashion\/2020\/jul\/14\/fast-fashion-20-ways-stop-buying-new-clothes-fair-wage-wardrobes\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/fashion\/2020\/jul\/14\/fast-fashion-20-ways-stop-buying-new-clothes-fair-wage-wardrobes\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/fashion\/2020\/jul\/14\/fast-fashion-20-ways-stop-buying-new-clothes-fair-wage-wardrobes\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/blog.naturehub.com\/how-to-quit-fast-fashion\/\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/blog.naturehub.com\/how-to-quit-fast-fashion\/\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/blog.naturehub.com\/how-to-quit-fast-fashion\/\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.reluv.co.uk\/how-to-quit-fast-fashion\/\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/www.reluv.co.uk\/how-to-quit-fast-fashion\/\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/www.reluv.co.uk\/how-to-quit-fast-fashion\/\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/ethicalunicorn.com\/2020\/04\/24\/how-to-quit-fast-fashion\/\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/ethicalunicorn.com\/2020\/04\/24\/how-to-quit-fast-fashion\/\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/ethicalunicorn.com\/2020\/04\/24\/how-to-quit-fast-fashion\/\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

However, this celebration also carries huge amounts of food waste, improper recycling and another weekend of indulging the habits of overconsumption that are driving climate destruction.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFood waste is a large contributor to greenhouse emissions (\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.un.org\/press\/en\/2020\/dsgsm1465.doc.htm\x22\x3erepresenting approximately 8% of global emissions\x3c\/a\x3e), and this year, it is predicted that there will be 8,490 tonnes of food thrown away in the UK over the Easter weekend alone. Food waste is not just an environmentally-unfriendly habit, but also an economically wasteful one. According to a study by Tesco, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/resource.co\/article\/tesco-launches-guide-counter-8490-tonnes-easter-food-waste\x22\x3eonly 41% of people will use their leftovers \x3c\/a\x3ein another meal, yet the majority of foods will be safe to eat for a number of days after Easter, if stored properly. This also highlights the importance of planning meals in advance so that only the necessary amount of food is purchased, contributing to the reduction in food going to landfill, where it then decomposes and releases the dangerous gas, methane.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eEaster eggs are also another contributor the the problem of overconsumption and pollution during the holidays. Every year, over 3,000 tonnes of chocolate egg packaging is produced in the UK (Waste and Resources Action Programme, 2021), and most of this is not disposed of correctly. For example, the tinfoil that covers most eggs cannot be recycled unless it is a large enough quantity that it can be processed by the recycling machine. To recycle this material therefore, it is best to combine all the tinfoil leftover from Easter and mould it into a ball at least the size of a tennis ball, otherwise it will not be recycled. The plastic casing used for Easter eggs can sometimes be difficult to recycle, with the rule of thumb being that if you can scrunch it in your hand, you can‚Äôt recycle it. Cardboard is widely recycled at least, and with more and more brands feeling the pressure to improve the sustainability of their packaging, it is becoming easier to find \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.standard.co.uk\/futurelondon\/theplasticfreeproject\/plastic-free-easter-eggs-buy-ethical-eco-friendly-chocolate-fairtrade-biodegradable-packaging-a4100281.html\x22\x3eenvironmentally-friendly egg options\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThough the tradition of Easter dinners and egg-giving may be fundamental for many, there are ways to reduce your individual impact on the environment over the holiday. With over \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/news\/world-news\/10-fascinating-easter-facts-you-14384346\x22\x3e80 million eggs sold in the UK\x3c\/a\x3e every Easter, determine who in your life truly enjoys a chocolate gift and how much they really need one. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.cheaperwaste.co.uk\/blog\/easter-waste-and-how-to-avoid-it\/\x22\x3eThe average child will receive 8.8 eggs \x3c\/a\x3eover Easter, and while nobody is suggesting that the Easter Bunny stops coming altogether, perhaps it is worth adopting a ‚Äòsecret santa‚Äô model for Easter, where each family\/household member is responsible for buying only one egg, instead of getting an egg for everyone. This would help to reduce both food waste and recycling waste! When it comes to Easter meals, determine how much food is necessary and aim to prepare only that much. If there are any leftovers, get creative and use them in another meal the next day! There are also an \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.twinkl.co.uk\/blog\/7-easy-tips-for-an-eco-friendly-easter\x22\x3eabundance of resources online\x3c\/a\x3e to help you get creative with Easter traditions reminding us that traditions do not have to be stopped, but if we want to contribute to the fight against climate change, we have to look at some of these patterns of overconsumption and slowly dismantle them. Otherwise, how do we expect the Easter Bunny to hop through a wasteland of pollution?\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

No one should feel pressure to change their lifestyle simply because of the date, however, if you are someone who benefits from setting yourself New Year‚Äôs resolutions we have some ideas for you here at SHRUB.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3col\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eBecome a SHRUB member!\x3c\/strong\x3e This is a great way to support our work and you get a whole host of perks with it too! Our members get access to our ‚ÄòFree Rail‚Äô at the back of our store, they get tokens to spend in store on their account when they donate things to us which allows us to work towards a genuine circular economy, members get discounts at paid Shrub events, and discounts on renting out our space.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ol\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe have a sliding scale for our membership system meaning that you pay based on your income, we do this to ensure it is as accessible as possible.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e¬£12 is our minimum yearly membership fee (just ¬£1 a month!) This is suggested if you are a student, unemployed, or retired.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e¬£18 is suggested if you earn more than ¬£16k per year.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e¬£24 is suggested if you earn more than ¬£27k per year.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e¬£30 is suggested if you earn more ¬£43k per year.\n\n\x3col\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eVolunteer with us!\x3c\/strong\x3e In the New Year, a lot of the time people focus on ‚Äògiving up‚Äô certain habits. But what if instead of giving something up, you take something up? A few hours a week of voluntary work can do wonders for your community, your self-esteem and \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.mentalhealth.org.uk\/campaigns\/kindness\/kindness-matters-guide\x22\x3emental health\x3c\/a\x3e. We have a wide range of volunteering opportunities available at the moment and many of them are remote positions so whether you are itching to get some human interaction or itching to help but don‚Äôt want to take covid risks, there is likely something here for you! You can find out more \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/get-involved\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWalk or cycle rather than driving\x3c\/strong\x3e. Obviously, not everyone is able to walk longer distances or tackle the hills of Edinburgh by bike! However, if you are able to or keen to try, using active travel methods rather than a car can be hugely beneficial to the environment and to your mental wellbeing! Have a read of our article \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/getting-onto-the-saddle\/\x22\x3eGetting onto the Saddle\x3c\/a\x3e for some tips on how to start cycling in Edinburgh. You can always pop down to our Wee Spoke Hub and get your bike repaired, learn to repair your bike, or buy a second hand bike there!\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eFamiliarise yourself with our Zero Waste Edinburgh Map\x3c\/strong\x3e. We created \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/zero-waste-edinburgh\/\x22\x3ethis map\x3c\/a\x3e a few years ago to make living sustainably in Edinburgh a little bit easier! It is an ongoing project and we are finding ourselves continually adding to it as new Zero Waste spaces emerge in the city. If you are ever wondering where the nearest zero waste spots are, just have a look at this map and it should keep you right!\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eTry veggie or vegan food.\x3c\/strong\x3e ‚ÄòVeganuary‚Äô is becoming a word that more and more people are familiar with. If you‚Äôve not yet heard of it, then welcome! Veganuary aims to encourage people to go vegan for the month of January and beyond, with recipe inspiration, nutritional tips, shopping guidance and a whole online community that you can use as a support network. On their website they state that ‚ÄòDuring the 2021 campaign, more than 500,000 people took our pledge to try a vegan diet, while more than 825 new vegan products and menu options were launched in our key campaign countries.‚Äô This is a huge achievement and all these individuals and companies must have been getting on board for a reason. There is \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.greenpeace.org.uk\/news\/why-meat-is-bad-for-the-environment\/\x22\x3ecountless research\x3c\/a\x3e proving that a diet low in animal products significantly reduces our impact on the environment. A huge part of the responsibility lies with big corporations who are exploiting animals and burning down large quantities of forest-land to make way for industrial animal farming projects (including \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ki9PoTWiMTk\x26t=36s\x22\x3egrowing animal feed\x3c\/a\x3e). However, as consumers we have a lot of power! As we can see from Veganuary‚Äôs statistics, if customers are buying less meat and more vegan produce, the supermarkets will alter what they are stocking. Therefore the more people who reduce their animal product consumption, the less demand there will be for industrial farming. Reducing your meat and dairy consumption is a huge thing you can do for our planet this January!\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eMake a donation.\x3c\/strong\x3e Our staff and volunteers are upbeat and cheerful as often as they can be so, much of the time, it doesn‚Äôt look like we are facing any hardship at Shrub! However, we have lost two of our major funders this year which means our future is very uncertain and we no longer have financial security. We realise that many people within our community are not in a financial position to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/donate\/\x22\x3edonate money\x3c\/a\x3e, however, if you have the means any donations towards our project would massively help us to continue our work! If you cannot donate, feel free to share this information encouraging others to donate!\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eGet your food from our Food Sharing Hub.\x3c\/strong\x3e We have amazing teams of volunteers working to rescue perfectly good food from supermarkets that might otherwise be sent to landfill. The food in our Food Sharing Hub is available on a pay-what-you-feel basis so people can make a donation if they are in a position to but people can also take the food for free if they are not in a position to donate. It is a non-judgmental space, we are just happy that the food is being saved!\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eShop second hand.\x3c\/strong\x3e What if we did second-hand September‚Ä¶but all year round? The textile industry is one of the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/fashion\/2019\/jun\/23\/five-ways-fashion-damages-the-planet\x22\x3elargest polluting industries in the world\x3c\/a\x3e. One of the most powerful behaviour-change actions that an individual can take to tackle the climate crisis is buying less clothing and when you do need something, buy it second hand! This is also a better option for your wallet a lot of the time too!\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ol\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n"

Whatever occasion is being celebrated during the winter period, one need only look towards the high street to see the thronging crowds purchasing anything and everything that adorns the festive windows. As the madness of the holiday season descends, the amount households spend within this period ascends, with a total of \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.pwc.co.uk\/industries\/retail-consumer\/insights\/festive-predictions.html\x22\x3e¬£21bn expected to be spent during the season\x3c\/a\x3e. It‚Äôs no wonder then that the months October to December are dubbed the ‚ÄòGolden Quarter‚Äô - it‚Äôs a gold mine for retailers. But what does this mean for our planet and its people?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eDecorations\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eGetting into the festive spirit often inspires our most creative selves, involving lights, candles and Christmas trees - to name but a few. It is unfortunately all too easy forget that the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.businessleader.co.uk\/the-dark-environmental-impacts-of-our-christmas-season\/\x22\x3e8 million trees cut down\x3c\/a\x3e in the UK alone represents our destructive tendencies more than it represents our creative ones. A huge part of the problem with decorations, and the holiday season in general, is the amount of waste generated. While \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/cleanchoiceenergy.com\/news\/real-vs-artificial-trees\x22\x3ereal trees are more environmentally-friendly than artificial ones\x3c\/a\x3e, the improper disposal of them can have a significant carbon footprint, and so it is incredibly important to make sure that we recycle our trees once the festive season has passed. In recent years, there has been a growing movement encouraging consumers to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/theecochristmastreecompany.co.uk\x22\x3erent trees\x3c\/a\x3e instead of purchasing them, and while this is not yet widely available, it is something to keep an eye out for in the future! Other easy swaps to make include the reuse of last year‚Äôs decorations, swapping wax candles for soy ones, and making decorations from leftover materials lying around the house. From paper to fabric decorations, you can find plenty of inspiration and tutorials online - let your imagination run wild!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3ePresents\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFor many of us, our earliest memories of the winter holidays centre around the excitement of receiving presents. As we get older, this might shift more towards a pressure of giving presents, but either way, gifts still comprise a large part of the holiday season for a large proportion of the UK population. While there can be a sense of joy in choosing the perfect gift for a loved one, all too often, we are pressured by the marketing giants of the world into finding superfluous gifts for everyone in our lives, and this inevitably leads to an excess of consumption and waste. This year, perhaps think of gifting experiences instead of items. After the difficulties of the last few years on the hospitality sector, vouchers to local restaurants and cafes make wonderful presents that help to give back to the community. You could also consider making your own presents, drawing on your more creative talents, or simply come out and ask if there is anything that your partner\/friends\/family need - that way, you will know that the item is getting used. As far as gift-giving goes, let‚Äôs prove that it really is the thought that counts - a thought for our planet! Oh, and ditch the wrapping paper - \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.allthingssupplychain.com\/the-wrapping-paper-waste-problem-and-what-can-be-done-about-it\/\x22\x3eit does nothing good for our environment\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eFood\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhile the holidays can be a tricky time for many, some of the most common traditions this time of year centre around food. Turkey or ham, pudding versus cake, sprouts or no sprouts - the images of families gathered around tables buckling under the weight of the food are everywhere, including in many homes. In the UK, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/commercialwaste.trade\/the-true-cost-of-christmas\/\x22\x3e80% more food is consumed around Christmas\x3c\/a\x3e than at any other time in the year. The amount of carbon released in the production of this food, the amount of energy required to prepare it, and the tonnes of waste produced at the end of the season demonstrates just how harmful our overconsumption of food is. So \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/life-and-style\/ways-to-avoid-waste-with-your-christmas-food-shop-1.4743970\x22\x3ehow do we combat this\x3c\/a\x3e? Firstly, we need to think seriously about how much food we actually require, so as to reduce the amount that goes to waste in the first place. Making small changes, such as choosing more vegetables over meat, or buying only local ingredients, can have a significant impact on our carbon footprint this year too. While adopting zero-waste recipes may seem a bit drastic, learning how to make the most of your ingredients (\x3cem\x3eevery\x3c\/em\x3e element of them) can open up so many new dishes to us, like \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.foodsavvy.org.uk\/brussel-sprout-sauerkraut\x22\x3ethis recipe\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eP.S. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.bbcgoodfood.com\/recipes\/bubble-squeak\x22\x3eChristmas leftovers\x3c\/a\x3e are my favourite part of Christmas anyway!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThis festive season, all of us at Shrub Coop want to wish you a safe, peaceful and relaxing holiday period. We all know how important it is to take a break from the stress of normal life, and so we want to remind you that you don‚Äôt need to commit to a zero-waste holiday to prove you care about the planet: every small swap is a step in the right direction. We all deserve some time to recharge and to enjoy ourselves, so whatever holiday you are celebrating, and whoever you are celebrating with, we hope it is a magical time for you and we look forward to seeing you in the New Year!\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

This year, instead of adding to the mountains of unwanted gifts that will end up in charity shops or landfill before the end of January, why not get creative and upcycle some textile gifts?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSome of the following ideas require a bit of sewing know-how but others can be completed without a needle and thread!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWith the rise in popularity of gardening during lockdown, an easy planter made from old footwear might make a very popular gift. For a low maintenance indoor plant, you can add succulents while old wellies are a great option for the garden and can be planted with anything you like! \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/wonderfuldiy.com\/old-shoe-planters\/\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/wonderfuldiy.com\/old-shoe-planters\/\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/wonderfuldiy.com\/old-shoe-planters\/\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWith only an old t-shirt, a pair of scissors and sometimes (but not always) a needle and thread, you can make an amazing tote bag. Patterned t-shirts are good for this project and band t-shirts are even better! No sew instructions: \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.kenarry.com\/upcycle-t-shirt-tote-bag\/\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/www.kenarry.com\/upcycle-t-shirt-tote-bag\/\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/www.kenarry.com\/upcycle-t-shirt-tote-bag\/\x3c\/a\x3e Sew instructions: \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/muslinandmerlot.blogspot.com\/2015\/06\/upcycled-t-shirt-tote.html\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/muslinandmerlot.blogspot.com\/2015\/06\/upcycled-t-shirt-tote.html\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/muslinandmerlot.blogspot.com\/2015\/06\/upcycled-t-shirt-tote.html\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWhile face masks are nobody‚Äôs favourite item, it looks like we might be wearing them for a while. There are literally hundreds of tutorials online showing you how to make facemasks and some of them don‚Äôt even need any sewing. (Look for patterns that have at least two layers of fabric which is the current government guidance for effective face coverings).\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eYou can use almost any type of fabric to make a rag rug and they can be wonderfully colourful or stylishly muted depending on the resources you have available. They do take a little bit of time though, so if you‚Äôre aiming for Christmas 2021 you‚Äôd better get started! The same process can be followed to make coasters and placemats\/trivets if you‚Äôre short on either time or scraps. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/upcyclemystuff.com\/9-ways-to-make-a-rag-rug-youll-want-to-try\/\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/upcyclemystuff.com\/9-ways-to-make-a-rag-rug-youll-want-to-try\/\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/upcyclemystuff.com\/9-ways-to-make-a-rag-rug-youll-want-to-try\/\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eFor a creative gift with bohemian vibes, you can make fabric feathers and tie them into a garland. You‚Äôll need woven fabric scraps for this one, with tartan and tweed working especially well. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.pillarboxblue.com\/diy-feathers-from-upcycled-fabric\/\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/www.pillarboxblue.com\/diy-feathers-from-upcycled-fabric\/\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/www.pillarboxblue.com\/diy-feathers-from-upcycled-fabric\/\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eUsing only a pair of jeans and some stuffing (you can either use old rags or stuffing from an old pillow), you can make a useful and attractive draught excluder. This tutorial also shows how to stencil it with a message, but you can keep it plain too. If you don‚Äôt have a pair of jeans ready to upcycle, please come to the SHRUB Swapshop ‚Äì we have plenty! \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.hometalk.com\/diy\/repair\/air-conditioning\/upcycled-denim-draught-excluders-door-and-window--22097378\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/www.hometalk.com\/diy\/repair\/air-conditioning\/upcycled-denim-draught-excluders-door-and-window--22097378\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/www.hometalk.com\/diy\/repair\/air-conditioning\/upcycled-denim-draught-excluders-door-and-window‚Äì22097378\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOur Swapshop has an abundance of scrap fabrics that you can choose from to make your projects - drop by our Zero Waste Hub to rescue save some textile waste!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1639492072\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/IMG_9353_pygtff.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eA customer looks through our haberdashery section in the Zero Waste Hub.\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe‚Äôd love to hear how you get on if you make any of these projects, and let us know if you have any other upcycling projects you‚Äôre working on.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

Vegan. Organic. Fairtrade. Ethical. You name the buzzword, there‚Äôs a little badge or sticker attached to a product to indicate that the brand meets this standard. According to multiple studies, including \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/uk\/en\/pages\/consumer-business\/articles\/sustainable-consumer.html\x22\x3ethis recent Deloitte survey\x3c\/a\x3e, consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of their ‚Äòbuying power‚Äô: the ability to enact political decisions through their consumption habits. Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of products and the conditions within which products are grown and\/or produced. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/peterhorst\/2018\/04\/09\/rise-of-consumer-activism-spells-new-risks-for-brands-heres-what-you-can-do-now\/?sh=384d5b524659\x22\x3eConsumer activism\x3c\/a\x3e has therefore spelled a new challenge for brands and corporations as they attempt to engage with (or at least give the appearance of engaging with) issues of social justice. This has led to a rise in \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.ethicalconsumer.org\/transport-travel\/what-greenwashing\x22\x3egreenwashing campaigns \x3c\/a\x3eto appeal to the environmental activists out there, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/don-t-rainbow-wash-our-parade\/\x22\x3erainbow-washing\x3c\/a\x3e during Pride Month, and let us \x3cem\x3eplease\x3c\/em\x3e forget that infamous \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/nbcblk\/pepsi-ad-kendall-jenner-echoes-black-lives-matter-sparks-anger-n742811\x22\x3ePepsi ad\x3c\/a\x3e where Kendall Jenner was supposed to contribute to the #BlackLivesMatter movement. There seems no limit to what companies will do to continue to appeal to their consumer base, and the rise of product certifications appears to be another avenue for brands to demonstrate their corporate social responsibility in line with consumer demands.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIn recent years, various different boards of certification have emerged who supposedly monitor the practices of a company to ensure that they meet the standards demanded of the certification board. Rainforest Alliance is just one example of such a certification. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.rainforest-alliance.org\/approach\/\x22\x3eAccording to Rainforest Alliance‚Äôs website\x3c\/a\x3e, their mission is to ‚Äòprotect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.‚Äô Choosing products with the Rainforest Alliance Certified badge would therefore indicate that these products have been produced in environmentally- and socially- sound conditions. However, only a year ago, it emerged that the Rainforest Alliance was in fact \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/global-development\/2020\/may\/29\/rainforest-alliance-certifying-unethical-pineapple-farms-activists-claim\x22\x3ecertifying pineapple plantations that were far from ethical\x3c\/a\x3e, engaging in labour exploitation and environmentally-damaging practices. Prior to this scandal, the BBC Panorama produced a special on how \x3ca href=\x22http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/panorama\/hi\/front_page\/newsid_8583000\/8583499.stm\x22\x3eFairTrade certifications were prone to corruption and bribery\x3c\/a\x3e, meaning that many FairTrade products were no more ethical than their non-fairtrade counterparts. This is distressing for consumers who genuinely want to engage in more ethical consumption practices, as it appears that even the most recognisable certifications cannot be trusted.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhile it can seem deeply disheartening to learn that many certifications are simply the latest tool in capitalism‚Äôs belt to draw in the most ethically-minded consumers, there is some hope for us. Firstly, very much in line with the Shrub Coop ethos, we can recommend reducing consumption in general as a means to avoid falling victim to these certification schemes. Preserving and repairing textile and household items means that we can make what we already own last for years, and there is little more sustainable than shopping in your own home! In terms of food, buying local produce or even growing some of your own is a great way to reduce the carbon footprint of your food bill, and it gives you a greater sense of how the produce is grown (day trip to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/craigies.co.uk\/pick-your-own-fruit\/\x22\x3eCraigie‚Äôs Farm\x3c\/a\x3e, anyone?). Finally, do your research on brands and companies, and look into the certifications and claims that they make around corporate social responsibility. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/bcorporation.net\x22\x3eCertified B Corporations\x3c\/a\x3e are generally well-regarded, as companies are required to ‚Äòbalance purpose and profit‚Äô, meaning they must meet rather stringent standards of practice in order to attain this certification. The premise of certifications is to guide and reassure consumers, and we have to hope that many of them do fulfil that mission, but it is always better to be as informed as possible in order to more wholly engage with consumer activism.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

Sign made out of upcycled fabric by our sewing volunteer, Mary.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAfter being rescheduled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 26th Conference of the Parties, or COP26, has begun in the host city of Glasgow. Hundreds of state representatives from every region of the world will be in attendance to discuss the next steps necessary to take against climate change, with activists and experts from across the globe equally travelling to voice their concerns and demands for more effective climate action. COP26 holds extra significance, as it marks the first of the five-year review cycles proposed by the Paris Agreement at COP21. States will therefore be forced to scrutinise their efforts to deliver on their promises to reduce carbon emissions, as it has already been acknowledged that the international community is not on track to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. This is an important time for the climate justice movement, as we have an opportunity to hold our leaders accountable and demand that they take their targets and pledges seriously in the future. Having seen how certain populations were able to adapt to new lifestyles during COVID-19, there is no doubt that the human race is capable of transforming itself in the face of a crisis. What we need is the guidance and leadership to do it.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIt is clear that COP26 is therefore a landmark event, yet it arguably already overlooks some of the most valuable lessons we have learned from the pandemic - namely, that conferences can be conducted, and policies constructed, without the physical presence of every representative. As the world adapted to remote working, companies were able to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by allowing employees to attend \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/hub.airmeet.com\/environmental-benefits-of-remote-work\/\x22\x3evirtual meetings and conferences\x3c\/a\x3e, instead of flying around the globe to attend in person. This not only results in cleaner air and lower carbon footprints, but it also reduces the amount of waste that can be produced at in-person events : attendees arriving to meetings with fresh coffee in a single-use cup, the provision of pens and paper to draft proposals, the transportation from hotels to meeting venues, most of this energy and waste can be reduced by hosting virtual events. Of course, collaborative softwares and online facilities use significant energy, and not every country is able to benefit from quick, reliable connections, but where possible, should climate leaders adopt a more environmentally-friendly model for these meetings?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eHosting events like COP26 online can provide additional benefits beyond their environmental impact. The states and cities hosting these events often spend considerable amounts preparing venues and hosting facilities for their international guests. Similar to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/ips-dc.org\/the-dark-side-of-hosting-the-olympics\/\x22\x3ehosting the Olympics\x3c\/a\x3e, there are often negative socioeconomic effects attached to hosting COP. In Glasgow, we have witnessed increased competition for accommodation, with many \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/news.stv.tv\/west-central\/cop26-lodging-crisis-thousands-of-delegates-without-somewhere-to-stay?amp\x22\x3erepresentatives and activists from the Global South in particular struggling to find somewhere to stay during the talks\x3c\/a\x3e. There have been many instances of homeowners and landlords \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.glasgowtimes.co.uk\/news\/19663686.renting-glasgow-home-pay-off-prices-soar-due-cop26\/\x22\x3erenting out their properties \x3c\/a\x3eto COP26 delegates for extortionate prices, and this has the knock-on effect of increasing competition for housing and accommodation amongst the city‚Äôs student and lower-income populations. The increased traffic to, and within, Glasgow also has a detrimental impact on the city, as regular commuters will suffer the consequences of increased visitors, without even mentioning the impact that this has on the city‚Äôs air quality and its carbon emissions more generally. There are clearly a number of significant costs attached to hosting COP, and with a focus on renewing our climate commitments, it might just be time to highlight pathways to more sustainable COPs in the future.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWith all this in mind, COP26 is undeniably a necessary event, as our world leaders must review the progress, or lack thereof, that has been made to tackle the climate crisis thus far. At Shrub Coop, we are going to be closely watching the results of these talks, in the hope that more concrete action will be taken in Scotland going forwards. For our community activists, there are a number of COP26 events that will be taking place in Glasgow, as well as online, which you can get involved with \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/ukcop26.org\/the-conference\/green-zone-programme-of-events\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e. We are hoping that COP26 presents a turning point for our global leaders - we know that the power to change is within us.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

  var str = "\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1634285947\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/funny-pictures-meme-fish-plastic-bag-5267399_kzxecz.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThere was a brief period where the term ‚Äòmicroplastics‚Äô was as ubiquitous as plastic itself is. A time when scientists and consumers alike were alarmed by the reports of plastic in our fish stocks and our drinking water, with one report even finding traces of \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/dec\/22\/microplastics-revealed-in-placentas-unborn-babies\x22\x3emicroplastics in unborn babies\x3c\/a\x3e. However, just as this health and environmental hazard was beginning to attract serious attention from the media and public, the COVID-19 pandemic overshadowed it, and microplastics skirted backwards into the corners of public consciousness. Now, as we begin to crawl out of the pandemic conditions and return to our pre-pandemic routines, it might be time to revisit the topic of microplastics.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eMicroplastics are tiny particles of plastic and they come from an array of sources, carrying with them a number of threatening effects. Often, we picture microplastics as the residue, the last remaining particles, of larger plastic items that have been broken down by the sun or the sea. However, these forms of microplastics constitute only part of the problem, and are in fact considered to be \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/news\/en\/headlines\/society\/20181116STO19217\/microplastics-sources-effects-and-solutions\x22\x3esecondary microplastics\x3c\/a\x3e. Primary microplastics, on the other hand, are the tiny particles that can be found in products such as synthetics (think microfibres) and cosmetics. These microplastics are, to a degree, intentionally created, although it is fair to assume that their environmental impacts are not so intentional. Distinguishing between the two types of microplastics is an important first step in addressing the problem of microplastics - without the tools to recognise them, how can we be expected to avoid them?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eRallying against secondary microplastics is somewhat straightforward - in theory. It largely requires us to avoid plastic products and to prolong the lives of the plastic items we already own. While going plastic-free is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, it is becoming more and more accessible, as outlined in our previous article \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/making-plastic-free-july-last-all-year\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e. When we reduce the amount of plastic being consumed in the first place, we eliminate opportunities for plastic to seep into our natural environments, causing harm to wildlife and human health. Tackling the problem of primary microplastics is, unfortunately, a little bit trickier. Since they can exist in clothing, it is extremely difficult to prevent the release of microplastics into our water systems as everybody has to wash their clothes at some point. However, when purchasing items (old or new!), we can try to be more aware of the fabrics that make up our clothing. The general rule of thumb would be to avoid man-made synthetics, and to stick to natural fabrics such as cotton and linen - for a comprehensive list of what fabrics to avoid, check out \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/reucse.com\/blogs\/news\/fabrics-microplastics-pollution\x22\x3ethis article\x3c\/a\x3e or to learn more about the benefits and drawbacks of different fabrics, you can read our \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/resource-packs\/fabric-awareness-information-booklet\/\x22\x3eFabric Awareness Booklet\x3c\/a\x3e made by SHRUB‚Äôs Sustainable Fashion Volunteers. Furthermore, when it comes to cosmetic products, we as consumers have to get a bit scientifically technical, so that we can recognise which ingredients to avoid in our products. Names such as \x3cem\x3epolyethylene, acrylates copolymer, ethylene and polymethyl\x3c\/em\x3e are just a few of the names to look out for, with a much more exhaustive list available \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.beatthemicrobead.org\/guide-to-microplastics\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e. Again, generally sticking to cosmetics made of natural, vegan ingredients is a safe route to avoid microplastic pollution.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eMicroplastics may seem like a tiny but powerful enemy that will never be eliminated, but there are steps that we as consumers can actively take to reduce the potency of these pollutants. While we may have become used to relying on plastic for protection during the COVID-19 pandemic (plastic coffee cups became our only option for a while), a return to normalcy means a return to action. And while we may not have always known the ways in which plastic wielded power over our lives (I‚Äôm looking at you, microbeads!), the more knowledge we have, the better equipped we are to demand change from our leaders, together. We are only beginning to see the effects of microplastics in our food chain, but we don‚Äôt have to wait to find out. Fish with a side of microplastics? I think I‚Äôll pass.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"
