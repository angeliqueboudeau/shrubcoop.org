Whatever occasion is being celebrated during the winter period, one need only look towards the high street to see the thronging crowds purchasing anything and everything that adorns the festive windows. As the madness of the holiday season descends, the amount households spend within this period ascends, with a total of \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.pwc.co.uk\/industries\/retail-consumer\/insights\/festive-predictions.html\x22\x3e£21bn expected to be spent during the season\x3c\/a\x3e. It’s no wonder then that the months October to December are dubbed the ‘Golden Quarter’ - it’s a gold mine for retailers. But what does this mean for our planet and its people?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eDecorations\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eGetting into the festive spirit often inspires our most creative selves, involving lights, candles and Christmas trees - to name but a few. It is unfortunately all too easy forget that the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.businessleader.co.uk\/the-dark-environmental-impacts-of-our-christmas-season\/\x22\x3e8 million trees cut down\x3c\/a\x3e in the UK alone represents our destructive tendencies more than it represents our creative ones. A huge part of the problem with decorations, and the holiday season in general, is the amount of waste generated. While \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/cleanchoiceenergy.com\/news\/real-vs-artificial-trees\x22\x3ereal trees are more environmentally-friendly than artificial ones\x3c\/a\x3e, the improper disposal of them can have a significant carbon footprint, and so it is incredibly important to make sure that we recycle our trees once the festive season has passed. In recent years, there has been a growing movement encouraging consumers to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/theecochristmastreecompany.co.uk\x22\x3erent trees\x3c\/a\x3e instead of purchasing them, and while this is not yet widely available, it is something to keep an eye out for in the future! Other easy swaps to make include the reuse of last year’s decorations, swapping wax candles for soy ones, and making decorations from leftover materials lying around the house. From paper to fabric decorations, you can find plenty of inspiration and tutorials online - let your imagination run wild!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3ePresents\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFor many of us, our earliest memories of the winter holidays centre around the excitement of receiving presents. As we get older, this might shift more towards a pressure of giving presents, but either way, gifts still comprise a large part of the holiday season for a large proportion of the UK population. While there can be a sense of joy in choosing the perfect gift for a loved one, all too often, we are pressured by the marketing giants of the world into finding superfluous gifts for everyone in our lives, and this inevitably leads to an excess of consumption and waste. This year, perhaps think of gifting experiences instead of items. After the difficulties of the last few years on the hospitality sector, vouchers to local restaurants and cafes make wonderful presents that help to give back to the community. You could also consider making your own presents, drawing on your more creative talents, or simply come out and ask if there is anything that your partner\/friends\/family need - that way, you will know that the item is getting used. As far as gift-giving goes, let’s prove that it really is the thought that counts - a thought for our planet! Oh, and ditch the wrapping paper - \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.allthingssupplychain.com\/the-wrapping-paper-waste-problem-and-what-can-be-done-about-it\/\x22\x3eit does nothing good for our environment\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eFood\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhile the holidays can be a tricky time for many, some of the most common traditions this time of year centre around food. Turkey or ham, pudding versus cake, sprouts or no sprouts - the images of families gathered around tables buckling under the weight of the food are everywhere, including in many homes. In the UK, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/commercialwaste.trade\/the-true-cost-of-christmas\/\x22\x3e80% more food is consumed around Christmas\x3c\/a\x3e than at any other time in the year. The amount of carbon released in the production of this food, the amount of energy required to prepare it, and the tonnes of waste produced at the end of the season demonstrates just how harmful our overconsumption of food is. So \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/life-and-style\/ways-to-avoid-waste-with-your-christmas-food-shop-1.4743970\x22\x3ehow do we combat this\x3c\/a\x3e? Firstly, we need to think seriously about how much food we actually require, so as to reduce the amount that goes to waste in the first place. Making small changes, such as choosing more vegetables over meat, or buying only local ingredients, can have a significant impact on our carbon footprint this year too. While adopting zero-waste recipes may seem a bit drastic, learning how to make the most of your ingredients (\x3cem\x3eevery\x3c\/em\x3e element of them) can open up so many new dishes to us, like \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.foodsavvy.org.uk\/brussel-sprout-sauerkraut\x22\x3ethis recipe\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eP.S. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.bbcgoodfood.com\/recipes\/bubble-squeak\x22\x3eChristmas leftovers\x3c\/a\x3e are my favourite part of Christmas anyway!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThis festive season, all of us at Shrub Coop want to wish you a safe, peaceful and relaxing holiday period. We all know how important it is to take a break from the stress of normal life, and so we want to remind you that you don’t need to commit to a zero-waste holiday to prove you care about the planet: every small swap is a step in the right direction. We all deserve some time to recharge and to enjoy ourselves, so whatever holiday you are celebrating, and whoever you are celebrating with, we hope it is a magical time for you and we look forward to seeing you in the New Year!\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

This year, instead of adding to the mountains of unwanted gifts that will end up in charity shops or landfill before the end of January, why not get creative and upcycle some textile gifts?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSome of the following ideas require a bit of sewing know-how but others can be completed without a needle and thread!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWith the rise in popularity of gardening during lockdown, an easy planter made from old footwear might make a very popular gift. For a low maintenance indoor plant, you can add succulents while old wellies are a great option for the garden and can be planted with anything you like! \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/wonderfuldiy.com\/old-shoe-planters\/\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/wonderfuldiy.com\/old-shoe-planters\/\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/wonderfuldiy.com\/old-shoe-planters\/\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWith only an old t-shirt, a pair of scissors and sometimes (but not always) a needle and thread, you can make an amazing tote bag.

There are literally hundreds of tutorials online showing you how to make facemasks and some of them don’t even need any sewing. (Look for patterns that have at least two layers of fabric which is the current government guidance for effective face coverings).\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eYou can use almost any type of fabric to make a rag rug and they can be wonderfully colourful or stylishly muted depending on the resources you have available. They do take a little bit of time though, so if you’re aiming for Christmas 2021 you’d better get started! The same process can be followed to make coasters and placemats\/trivets if you’re short on either time or scraps. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/upcyclemystuff.com\/9-ways-to-make-a-rag-rug-youll-want-to-try\/\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/upcyclemystuff.com\/9-ways-to-make-a-rag-rug-youll-want-to-try\/\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/upcyclemystuff.com\/9-ways-to-make-a-rag-rug-youll-want-to-try\/\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eFor a creative gift with bohemian vibes, you can make fabric feathers and tie them into a garland.

This tutorial also shows how to stencil it with a message, but you can keep it plain too. If you don’t have a pair of jeans ready to upcycle, please come to the SHRUB Swapshop – we have plenty! \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.hometalk.com\/diy\/repair\/air-conditioning\/upcycled-denim-draught-excluders-door-and-window--22097378\x22 title=\x22https:\/\/www.hometalk.com\/diy\/repair\/air-conditioning\/upcycled-denim-draught-excluders-door-and-window--22097378\x22\x3ehttps:\/\/www.hometalk.com\/diy\/repair\/air-conditioning\/upcycled-denim-draught-excluders-door-and-window–22097378\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOur Swapshop has an abundance of scrap fabrics that you can choose from to make your projects - drop by our Zero Waste Hub to rescue save some textile waste!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1639492072\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/IMG_9353_pygtff.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eA customer looks through our haberdashery section in the Zero Waste Hub.\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe’d love to hear how you get on if you make any of these projects, and let us know if you have any other upcycling projects you’re working on.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

We are particularly looking for people with experience in the fields of \x3cstrong\x3eHR, Fundraising and Social Enterprise\x3c\/strong\x3e but Trustees have a wide-ranging remit and there are opportunities for involvement across the work that SHRUB undertakes.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22why-become-a-trustee\x22\x3eWhy become a Trustee?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSHRUB is a cooperative with premises in central Edinburgh. Our Members contribute to decision-making processes. Trustees have special legal responsibilities and, in some circumstances may have to make sensitive or critical decisions on behalf of the Coop.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eA Steering Group was established in May 2020 and now helps staff and working groups take the day-to-day decisions - meaning the Trustees’ role is mainly oversight and strategy.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees learn about how our Social Enterprise runs and gain skills in leadership, problem - solving and innovation, strategic judgement and effective communication, to name a few.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eServing as a Trustee is an opportunity to learn about the governance of a not-for-profit organisation in a supportive environment, learning from more experienced Trustees and staff and the fresh perspective of newer Members alike.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22key-roles-in-trustee-team\x22\x3eKey Roles in Trustee team\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eConvenor\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eSecretary\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eTreasurer\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eSteering Group link\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eHR and Welfare support\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eFundraising support\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eRisk and Compliance lead\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eMonitoring and Evaluation support\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eGovernance and Policy lead\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eCommunications support\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eSocial Enterprise lead\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eStrategy and Vision lead\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22what-skills-do-i-need\x22\x3eWhat skills do I need?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees have a wide-ranging remit with some people leading on particular aspects, some playing a more general role. We are looking for people with experience and skills in the specific areas listed above, but we also welcome applications from people who want to develop their experience or who have a more general interest in SHRUB. We particularly encourage applications from under-represented groups, including but not limited to: people of colour, trans people, non-binary people and women.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees are responsible for overseeing development of the strategic framework within which day- to-day tasks are carried out by staffers and volunteers, and they help guide our long-term planning.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWhat is the time commitment?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs a voluntary Trustee, you will make some clear time commitments: to attend regular Trustee meetings (2 hours each month, currently on a Monday evening), and participate in staff support mechanisms.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees will preferably participate in the work of a Working Group - attending meetings where possible and contributing to the direction and content of work.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs a cooperative, SHRUB Coop makes transparent, and effective decisions mostly by a Steering Group. Trustees delegate the day-to-day decisions to the Steering Group, comprising Trustees, Members (both Volunteer and Supporter Members) and Staff. The Steering Group meets every fortnight.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTime off can be arranged among Trustees, ensuring that there is a balance between Trustees’ wellbeing and SHRUB Coop functioning. If you cannot make a meeting you can let people know. There is a Welfare Working Group to support mental, physical and emotional wellbeing of volunteers and members if you need support in regulating your engagement.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWho can apply?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAnyone who supports the Vision and Mission of SHRUB Coop is invited to apply.

Image source \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/national\/advocates-query-sustainability-brand-wagon-20130412-2hr2k.html\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSustainable. Vegan. Organic. Fairtrade. Ethical. You name the buzzword, there’s a little badge or sticker attached to a product to indicate that the brand meets this standard. According to multiple studies, including \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/uk\/en\/pages\/consumer-business\/articles\/sustainable-consumer.html\x22\x3ethis recent Deloitte survey\x3c\/a\x3e, consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of their ‘buying power’: the ability to enact political decisions through their consumption habits. Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of products and the conditions within which products are grown and\/or produced. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/peterhorst\/2018\/04\/09\/rise-of-consumer-activism-spells-new-risks-for-brands-heres-what-you-can-do-now\/?sh=384d5b524659\x22\x3eConsumer activism\x3c\/a\x3e has therefore spelled a new challenge for brands and corporations as they attempt to engage with (or at least give the appearance of engaging with) issues of social justice. This has led to a rise in \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.ethicalconsumer.org\/transport-travel\/what-greenwashing\x22\x3egreenwashing campaigns \x3c\/a\x3eto appeal to the environmental activists out there, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/don-t-rainbow-wash-our-parade\/\x22\x3erainbow-washing\x3c\/a\x3e during Pride Month, and let us \x3cem\x3eplease\x3c\/em\x3e forget that infamous \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/nbcblk\/pepsi-ad-kendall-jenner-echoes-black-lives-matter-sparks-anger-n742811\x22\x3ePepsi ad\x3c\/a\x3e where Kendall Jenner was supposed to contribute to the #BlackLivesMatter movement. There seems no limit to what companies will do to continue to appeal to their consumer base, and the rise of product certifications appears to be another avenue for brands to demonstrate their corporate social responsibility in line with consumer demands.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIn recent years, various different boards of certification have emerged who supposedly monitor the practices of a company to ensure that they meet the standards demanded of the certification board. Rainforest Alliance is just one example of such a certification. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.rainforest-alliance.org\/approach\/\x22\x3eAccording to Rainforest Alliance’s website\x3c\/a\x3e, their mission is to ‘protect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.’ Choosing products with the Rainforest Alliance Certified badge would therefore indicate that these products have been produced in environmentally- and socially- sound conditions. However, only a year ago, it emerged that the Rainforest Alliance was in fact \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/global-development\/2020\/may\/29\/rainforest-alliance-certifying-unethical-pineapple-farms-activists-claim\x22\x3ecertifying pineapple plantations that were far from ethical\x3c\/a\x3e, engaging in labour exploitation and environmentally-damaging practices. Prior to this scandal, the BBC Panorama produced a special on how \x3ca href=\x22http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/panorama\/hi\/front_page\/newsid_8583000\/8583499.stm\x22\x3eFairTrade certifications were prone to corruption and bribery\x3c\/a\x3e, meaning that many FairTrade products were no more ethical than their non-fairtrade counterparts. This is distressing for consumers who genuinely want to engage in more ethical consumption practices, as it appears that even the most recognisable certifications cannot be trusted.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhile it can seem deeply disheartening to learn that many certifications are simply the latest tool in capitalism’s belt to draw in the most ethically-minded consumers, there is some hope for us. Firstly, very much in line with the Shrub Coop ethos, we can recommend reducing consumption in general as a means to avoid falling victim to these certification schemes. Preserving and repairing textile and household items means that we can make what we already own last for years, and there is little more sustainable than shopping in your own home! In terms of food, buying local produce or even growing some of your own is a great way to reduce the carbon footprint of your food bill, and it gives you a greater sense of how the produce is grown (day trip to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/craigies.co.uk\/pick-your-own-fruit\/\x22\x3eCraigie’s Farm\x3c\/a\x3e, anyone?). Finally, do your research on brands and companies, and look into the certifications and claims that they make around corporate social responsibility. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/bcorporation.net\x22\x3eCertified B Corporations\x3c\/a\x3e are generally well-regarded, as companies are required to ‘balance purpose and profit’, meaning they must meet rather stringent standards of practice in order to attain this certification. The premise of certifications is to guide and reassure consumers, and we have to hope that many of them do fulfil that mission, but it is always better to be as informed as possible in order to more wholly engage with consumer activism.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

Sign made out of upcycled fabric by our sewing volunteer, Mary.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAfter being rescheduled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 26th Conference of the Parties, or COP26, has begun in the host city of Glasgow. Hundreds of state representatives from every region of the world will be in attendance to discuss the next steps necessary to take against climate change, with activists and experts from across the globe equally travelling to voice their concerns and demands for more effective climate action. COP26 holds extra significance, as it marks the first of the five-year review cycles proposed by the Paris Agreement at COP21. States will therefore be forced to scrutinise their efforts to deliver on their promises to reduce carbon emissions, as it has already been acknowledged that the international community is not on track to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. This is an important time for the climate justice movement, as we have an opportunity to hold our leaders accountable and demand that they take their targets and pledges seriously in the future. Having seen how certain populations were able to adapt to new lifestyles during COVID-19, there is no doubt that the human race is capable of transforming itself in the face of a crisis. What we need is the guidance and leadership to do it.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIt is clear that COP26 is therefore a landmark event, yet it arguably already overlooks some of the most valuable lessons we have learned from the pandemic - namely, that conferences can be conducted, and policies constructed, without the physical presence of every representative. As the world adapted to remote working, companies were able to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by allowing employees to attend \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/hub.airmeet.com\/environmental-benefits-of-remote-work\/\x22\x3evirtual meetings and conferences\x3c\/a\x3e, instead of flying around the globe to attend in person. This not only results in cleaner air and lower carbon footprints, but it also reduces the amount of waste that can be produced at in-person events : attendees arriving to meetings with fresh coffee in a single-use cup, the provision of pens and paper to draft proposals, the transportation from hotels to meeting venues, most of this energy and waste can be reduced by hosting virtual events. Of course, collaborative softwares and online facilities use significant energy, and not every country is able to benefit from quick, reliable connections, but where possible, should climate leaders adopt a more environmentally-friendly model for these meetings?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eHosting events like COP26 online can provide additional benefits beyond their environmental impact. The states and cities hosting these events often spend considerable amounts preparing venues and hosting facilities for their international guests. Similar to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/ips-dc.org\/the-dark-side-of-hosting-the-olympics\/\x22\x3ehosting the Olympics\x3c\/a\x3e, there are often negative socioeconomic effects attached to hosting COP. In Glasgow, we have witnessed increased competition for accommodation, with many \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/news.stv.tv\/west-central\/cop26-lodging-crisis-thousands-of-delegates-without-somewhere-to-stay?amp\x22\x3erepresentatives and activists from the Global South in particular struggling to find somewhere to stay during the talks\x3c\/a\x3e. There have been many instances of homeowners and landlords \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.glasgowtimes.co.uk\/news\/19663686.renting-glasgow-home-pay-off-prices-soar-due-cop26\/\x22\x3erenting out their properties \x3c\/a\x3eto COP26 delegates for extortionate prices, and this has the knock-on effect of increasing competition for housing and accommodation amongst the city’s student and lower-income populations. The increased traffic to, and within, Glasgow also has a detrimental impact on the city, as regular commuters will suffer the consequences of increased visitors, without even mentioning the impact that this has on the city’s air quality and its carbon emissions more generally. There are clearly a number of significant costs attached to hosting COP, and with a focus on renewing our climate commitments, it might just be time to highlight pathways to more sustainable COPs in the future.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWith all this in mind, COP26 is undeniably a necessary event, as our world leaders must review the progress, or lack thereof, that has been made to tackle the climate crisis thus far. At Shrub Coop, we are going to be closely watching the results of these talks, in the hope that more concrete action will be taken in Scotland going forwards. For our community activists, there are a number of COP26 events that will be taking place in Glasgow, as well as online, which you can get involved with \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/ukcop26.org\/the-conference\/green-zone-programme-of-events\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e. We are hoping that COP26 presents a turning point for our global leaders - we know that the power to change is within us.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

  var str = "\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1634285947\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/funny-pictures-meme-fish-plastic-bag-5267399_kzxecz.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThere was a brief period where the term ‘microplastics’ was as ubiquitous as plastic itself is. A time when scientists and consumers alike were alarmed by the reports of plastic in our fish stocks and our drinking water, with one report even finding traces of \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/dec\/22\/microplastics-revealed-in-placentas-unborn-babies\x22\x3emicroplastics in unborn babies\x3c\/a\x3e. However, just as this health and environmental hazard was beginning to attract serious attention from the media and public, the COVID-19 pandemic overshadowed it, and microplastics skirted backwards into the corners of public consciousness. Now, as we begin to crawl out of the pandemic conditions and return to our pre-pandemic routines, it might be time to revisit the topic of microplastics.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eMicroplastics are tiny particles of plastic and they come from an array of sources, carrying with them a number of threatening effects. Often, we picture microplastics as the residue, the last remaining particles, of larger plastic items that have been broken down by the sun or the sea. However, these forms of microplastics constitute only part of the problem, and are in fact considered to be \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/news\/en\/headlines\/society\/20181116STO19217\/microplastics-sources-effects-and-solutions\x22\x3esecondary microplastics\x3c\/a\x3e. Primary microplastics, on the other hand, are the tiny particles that can be found in products such as synthetics (think microfibres) and cosmetics. These microplastics are, to a degree, intentionally created, although it is fair to assume that their environmental impacts are not so intentional. Distinguishing between the two types of microplastics is an important first step in addressing the problem of microplastics - without the tools to recognise them, how can we be expected to avoid them?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eRallying against secondary microplastics is somewhat straightforward - in theory. It largely requires us to avoid plastic products and to prolong the lives of the plastic items we already own. While going plastic-free is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, it is becoming more and more accessible, as outlined in our previous article \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/making-plastic-free-july-last-all-year\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e. When we reduce the amount of plastic being consumed in the first place, we eliminate opportunities for plastic to seep into our natural environments, causing harm to wildlife and human health. Tackling the problem of primary microplastics is, unfortunately, a little bit trickier. Since they can exist in clothing, it is extremely difficult to prevent the release of microplastics into our water systems as everybody has to wash their clothes at some point. However, when purchasing items (old or new!), we can try to be more aware of the fabrics that make up our clothing. The general rule of thumb would be to avoid man-made synthetics, and to stick to natural fabrics such as cotton and linen - for a comprehensive list of what fabrics to avoid, check out \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/reucse.com\/blogs\/news\/fabrics-microplastics-pollution\x22\x3ethis article\x3c\/a\x3e or to learn more about the benefits and drawbacks of different fabrics, you can read our \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/resource-packs\/fabric-awareness-information-booklet\/\x22\x3eFabric Awareness Booklet\x3c\/a\x3e made by SHRUB’s Sustainable Fashion Volunteers. Furthermore, when it comes to cosmetic products, we as consumers have to get a bit scientifically technical, so that we can recognise which ingredients to avoid in our products. Names such as \x3cem\x3epolyethylene, acrylates copolymer, ethylene and polymethyl\x3c\/em\x3e are just a few of the names to look out for, with a much more exhaustive list available \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.beatthemicrobead.org\/guide-to-microplastics\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e. Again, generally sticking to cosmetics made of natural, vegan ingredients is a safe route to avoid microplastic pollution.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eMicroplastics may seem like a tiny but powerful enemy that will never be eliminated, but there are steps that we as consumers can actively take to reduce the potency of these pollutants. While we may have become used to relying on plastic for protection during the COVID-19 pandemic (plastic coffee cups became our only option for a while), a return to normalcy means a return to action. And while we may not have always known the ways in which plastic wielded power over our lives (I’m looking at you, microbeads!), the more knowledge we have, the better equipped we are to demand change from our leaders, together. We are only beginning to see the effects of microplastics in our food chain, but we don’t have to wait to find out. Fish with a side of microplastics? I think I’ll pass.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

This campaign began as a means to raise awareness of the environmental impact of fast fashion. Throughout September, Oxfam encourages consumers to donate their unwanted clothing to the charity and to buy secondhand fashion from Oxfam (and other charity) shops. This campaign aligns closely with a lot of what we do here at Shrub Coop, as we promote sustainable, secondhand shopping through our very own swap shop and Depop. However, this Secondhand September, we want to highlight how we can find more than just clothing in the preloved market.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOverconsumption is one the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/oxfam.medium.com\/the-carbon-inequality-era-71e20205a0d4\x22\x3ebiggest drivers of the climate crisis\x3c\/a\x3e, which is why changing our consumption habits is one of the most effective ways to fight against the climate crisis. The sustainable fashion movement has grown hugely in recent years, with consumers becoming increasingly conscious of the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/a-less-than-cheerful-assessment-of-the-fashion-industry-part-ii-2\/\x22\x3eenvironmental\x3c\/a\x3e and \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/strut-your-sustainable-stuff\/\x22\x3eethical\x3c\/a\x3e impacts of new clothing, however fashion is not the only damaging industry we need to transform. The production of any item involves the extraction of resources and the use of energy, therefore it is important to reduce the amount of new items being produced in the first place. This is where secondhand shopping - for books, for furniture, for anything really - steps in.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOne of the easiest swaps to make from new to preloved is buying books secondhand. As students, one of the best ways to save money (and the planet!) is to purchase textbooks secondhand, either through older students or through secondhand booksellers (Blackwells buy and sell used textbooks, as one example). Shrub has a large range of fiction and non-fiction available in our shop, as well as having scoped out a number of online used booksellers in our \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/these-storied-pages\/\x22\x3eprevious post here\x3c\/a\x3e. More and more frequently, household items such as cutlery, mugs and vases are being donated to charity shops and online recycling websites, and these items are a welcome addition to almost any home - once again, saving you money and saving the planet. A stroll into Shrub Coop will greet you with a large range of miscellaneous items, from plates to unicycles, showcasing the many different ways that you can engage in secondhand shopping.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eEvery item bought secondhand has a double advantage: it redirects waste from landfill, and it reduces the amount of materials and energy used to create new items. All sorts of gems can be found when shopping secondhand, and there is something particularly enthralling about giving a preloved item a new lease of life. So, as Secondhand September draws to a close, perhaps we can open ourselves to more ways of secondhand shopping all throughout the year. Doesn’t every item deserve a second (or third, or twentieth) chance?\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

Craftivism is a form of activism channelled through crafting, and \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/craftivism.com\x22\x3ecraftivists are called to use their crafting abilities to help the greater good\x3c\/a\x3e. Craftivism is a holistic and innovative form of activism, veering away from the more traditional forms of activism such as writing petitions, hosting sit-ins or marching in protests. Instead, craftivism focuses on the smaller actions that individuals can take to \x3ca href=\x22http:\/\/thebaksaproject.in\/crafting-resistance-how-contemporary-craftivists-are-using-their-handiwork-to-voice-dissent\/\x22\x3echallenge the institutions and norms they object to\x3c\/a\x3e. For example, many craftivists use their sewing skills to mend damaged clothing and extend its life, thus rejecting the fast fashion industry’s promotion of replacing items every season. Others have taken up knitting as a means to understand just how much time and effort is necessary to produce just one item of clothing, further emphasising the inequality of the fast fashion industry which underpays garment workers for their time, energy and skills. Craftivism does not just take aim at the fast fashion industry, however. In Prestwick, a local woman used her knitting skills to produce \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.pointsoflight.gov.uk\/knitting-for-scotland\/\x22\x3eone blanket a week for the Shelter Scotland\x3c\/a\x3e, exemplifying the myriad of ways crafting can be used for good.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhile craftivism is not a new phenomenon, it began to pick up even greater attention during the COVID-19 lockdowns of the last year and a half. As people were forced to slow down and spend time at home, many used the lockdown as an opportunity to return to or develop a new hobby. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2020\/aug\/03\/hobbycraft-reports-boom-in-online-sales-since-start-of-pandemic-crafts-coronavirus\x22\x3eHobbycraft witnessed a 200% sales increase during the start of the pandemic\x3c\/a\x3e, testifying to this renewed interest in crafting, and the results of this crafting surge extended beyond the simple goal of ‘passing the time’. Crafting has been found to be hugely beneficial in \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.redonline.co.uk\/health-self\/self\/a532010\/making-and-crafting-mental-health\/\x22\x3ereducing stress and tackling mental health issues\x3c\/a\x3e. It provides crafters with a distraction from the world and helps them to slow down and break away from the fast pace of life that can be so overwhelming. Not only that, but the communities formed around crafting activities are an important source of connection, proving crafting is not just a creative outlet but a social one.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIncorporating these benefits from crafting into activism can only enhance movements for change. When engaging in activism, it is easy to feel overwhelmed when confronted with powerful opponents in politics and industry, and it is not uncommon to feel defeated or \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/effectiveactivist.com\/movements\/burnout\/\x22\x3eburnt out from these actions\x3c\/a\x3e. Craftivism can play a huge role in overcoming activist burnout, as those involved in this form of activism can continue to fight the good fight in a different way; one which prioritises mental wellbeing and which thrives on slower, more intentional action. Taking to the streets and shouting from the rooftops will always hold power, but craftivism is another impactful way to engage with the issues facing our world today. When the Craftivists Collective presented Marks and Spencer shareholders with \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/craftivist-collective.com\/What-we-achieved-at-Marks-and-Spencer-AGM\x22\x3ehandkerchiefs they had made that highlighted the importance of paying workers a fair wage\x3c\/a\x3e, the company took this message to heart and increased the minimum wage in their company. Activism can take many forms, and craftivism may just be the perfect tool for any aspiring creative individuals out there.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

While we should all now be aware of the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/newsround\/58156019\x22\x3efashion industry’s contribution to climate change\x3c\/a\x3e, we do still need to wear (and therefore sometimes buy) clothes.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eBut knowing about the causes of climate change and being aware of our consumer power comes with great responsibility – when you need new pants\/socks\/trousers\/shoes, how do you make the most ethical choice?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs consumers we have more choice than ever, and thanks to a growing awareness and responsibility among those in the fashion industry, there is an excellent range of sustainable options for almost any item you need.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eBut what is the most important thing to look for? Is it better to choose organic cotton, which has less of an environmental impact on the soil in which it’s grown or something that was made in an ethical factory that provides education and healthcare, as well as a fair living wage to all its employees? How about something printed and assembled in the UK, reducing the miles it travels between the factories where it gets its treatments? When combined with the other considerations of price, availability and personal preference, the choices can become overwhelming. Caring so much can soon seem like a curse, how do you make a choice?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3ePart of the reason that these choices are more complex now compared to twenty years ago is that very few fashion brands then were engaged with sustainability. The majority probably didn’t care about workers’ rights or the provenance of their materials and so, irrespective of your own concerns, you didn’t have a sustainable option and a therefore simpler choice. That such a growing number of brands have added ethical or sustainable ranges (if not their whole offering) is in part down to consumer pressure. It’s important that we continue to promote the brands that are making real progress in their efforts to produce clothing in a way that has a minimal environmental impact. Of course, it has to be recognised that there are still many fashion brands who don’t acknowledge the huge role their industry plays in climate change – your consumer voice (and your wallet) are the best tools you have to drive change. Shop with sustainable brands where you can, and where you can’t, use social media to tell other brands how they can improve. Fashion Revolution have \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fashionrevolution.org\/resources\/how-tos\/\x22\x3elots of information\x3c\/a\x3e on how to maximise the impact of your actions.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIn answer to the question at the top of the page, the very fact that you’re spending time considering your purchasing options means that you’re likely to make a more sustainable choice. Whether you’re looking at a brand’s credentials, reading a clothing label or considering how you’ll use and care for the garment, you’re engaging with the reality of the fashion industry and the power your money can hold in encouraging brands to keep getting it right. You should feel good about whatever choice you then make.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eSome tips for a sustainable purchase\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3col\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eDo you need it? Do you already have something at home that would serve the same purpose? Remember – the most sustainable piece of clothing is one you already own.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWhat’s your budget? There is nothing to be gained by spending amounts that are unaffordable to you, no matter how sustainable the item. A less pricey, and more sustainable alternative to buying new is to buy second hand. Charity shops, eBay, Depop and similar sites all have an amazing array of barely (and in some cases never) worn clothes.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eFind a reliable source of information on who in the fashion industry takes sustainability seriously. The \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fashionrevolution.org\/about\/transparency\/\x22\x3eFashion Transparency Index\x3c\/a\x3e might be a good place to start and you can find brands that align best with your values.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eDo your research on fabrics and find the ones that you’ll be able to care for in a way that easy for you. The better you care for clothing, the less frequently you’ll need to shop for more! \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/resource-packs\/fabric-awareness-information-booklet\/\x22\x3eSHRUB has a booklet that can help with this.\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eYou may need to accept that the “perfect” item (e.g. something that ticks all the sustainability boxes) might not be available to you, in which case just make the best choice you can find. After all, if you need some pants, buy some pants!\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ol\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eBy now it’s recognised that remaining informed about and engaging with the climate crisis can cause anxiety for some people and as such, please be kind to yourself and try not to feel like you alone have to shoulder the weight of the world’s problems. If you are finding the topics discussed overwhelming, please talk to someone about it. SAMH can offer information and advice on dealing with anxiety.\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n"
