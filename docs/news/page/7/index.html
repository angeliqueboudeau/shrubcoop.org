It‚Äôs a difficult time - not being able to see our loved ones, many of us not being able to go to work, or no longer having a job at all. I for one know how easy it can be in these circumstances to let your wellbeing slide. However, that makes it all the more important to look after our mental health, as well as physical. The \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/introducing-the-welfare-working-group\/\x22\x3ewelfare team here at the SHRUB Coop\x3c\/a\x3e has put together a few tips to help you make lockdown a little kinder on our wellbeing.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22give-yourself-a-break\x22\x3eGive Yourself A Break\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe single most meaningful thing you can do for yourself during lockdown is go easy on yourself. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up ‚Äì about anything. However you‚Äôre feeling, whatever you can or can‚Äôt do at the moment, it‚Äôs a much more radical and compassionate thing to accept it than to fight it. For me, I went into lockdown with a list as long as my arm of things I wanted to achieve. Now, more than a month in, there are some days when I count simply getting dressed as an achievement, to be celebrated as much as all the other lofty goals I had set myself. And I feel that that is one of the kindest things I could have done for myself. If you do have the energy and mental space to be productive - whatever that means to you - then crack on! But if all you can do is survive, that‚Äôs just as significant.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIf you‚Äôre looking for something to occupy the time, but without the pressure to feel productive or achieve something, how about getting out some coloured pencils and giving mindful colouring a try? There are loads of books available online, and our graphic design volunteer, Hannah, has made some sketches available for you to download and print at home.\x3cbr \/\x3e\n\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1589299618\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/SHRUB_colouring_page_1_oidiyb.pdf\x22 title=\x22SHRUB_colouring_page_1_oidiyb.pdf\x22\x3eSHRUB_colouring_page_1.pdf\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1589299608\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/SHRUB_colouring_page_2_lqkiql.pdf\x22 title=\x22SHRUB_colouring_page_2_lqkiql.pdf\x22\x3eSHRUB_colouring_page_2.pdf\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22have-a-routine\x22\x3eHave a Routine\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe current COVID-19 crisis has kicked up a lot of instability. It‚Äôs almost impossible to tell where we‚Äôll be in just two weeks‚Äô time, and that uncertainty can have \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/afsp.org\/story\/taking-care-of-your-mental-health-in-the-face-of-uncertainty\x22\x3ea significant effect on anyone‚Äôs mental health\x3c\/a\x3e. However, there are some things you can do to make it easier, and one of the biggest ones is giving yourself a routine. It doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated; something as simple as waking up and going to bed at similar times, or trying to keep up regular meals, can have a massive effect. It just gives you that little bit of direction that will help you feel more like yourself. And if some days you throw your routine out the window, that‚Äôs also ok! I‚Äôm always a big fan of making things up as you go along, I just know it can be comforting to have something familiar to fall back on.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22move-your-body\x22\x3eMove Your Body\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIn a society where exercise is all too often only seen as a means to an end, it can be easy to forget that moving your body can be an important part of self-care. It can be both \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.helpguide.org\/articles\/healthy-living\/the-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise.htm\x22\x3erelaxing and energising\x3c\/a\x3e, and I for one enjoy spending time out of my head and in my body ‚Äì things which are more important than ever during such stressful times as these. However, it‚Äôs just as essential to make sure that you‚Äôre actually enjoying yourself. Now is not the time to be forcing yourself to do something because you feel you ‚Äúhave to‚Äù. If running and intense strength-building exercises aren‚Äôt your thing, there‚Äôs plenty of other things to try. From yoga and Pilates, to all types of dance, or even simply going for a walk, there‚Äôs something out there for every ability level, no matter how much space or time you have ‚Äìfind something that feels good to you!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22be-mindful-about-the-news-you-consume\x22\x3eBe Mindful About The News You Consume\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThis is something I haven‚Äôt seen talked about much online, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve personally found incredibly helpful in calming my mind. How you go about this is very individual, as it all depends on what affects you. Obviously, staying informed is always important, especially in times like these, but if being plugged into a 24-hour news cycle comes at the expense of your mental health, then you may want to consider changing your habits. The extreme end would be to completely stop reading the news, perhaps asking a friend to keep you up to date with the essentials so you‚Äôre not completely out of the loop. If completely switching off from the news isn‚Äôt for you, why not try reducing how often you are exposed to it? If you get a lot of your news through social media, making it something you can‚Äôt escape from, try temporarily unfollowing news outlets or blocking some key words from your feed. You‚Äôll then have to go search out the news, which you‚Äôll be less likely to do when you don‚Äôt have the mental space for it. And if you‚Äôre finding the news is making everything seem dire, here are some amazing community initiatives to help you feel positive;\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/229180471560632\/\x22\x3eEdinburgh Mask Makers\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1500699350098765\x22\x3eFor The Love of Scrubs\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.crowdfunder.co.uk\/edinburgh-emergency-medical-supplies\x22\x3eEdinburgh Shield Force\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NourishingChangeEdinburgh\/\x22\x3eNourishing Change\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/leith-community-crops-in-pots.org\x22\x3eLeith Crops In Pots\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eHowever, you could also find yourself on the other end of the spectrum. I was like this. I found that not keeping myself informed made me feel worse, catastrophising everything and feeling helpless. To combat this, I started consuming the news regularly ‚Äì but paying attention to what sources I was getting it from. I try to avoid the updates-every-minute news, and opt for less sensationalised, more fact-based news. My own personal recommendation is \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCSMqateX8OA2s1wsOR2EgJA\x22\x3eTLDR News\x3c\/a\x3e, an independent outlet whose aim is to make complex topics more simple. Much like what I said earlier about exercise, however, the most important thing is to find something that works for you.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFinding something that helps your mental health, rather than hurts it, is crucial in times like these. We hope that this has given you some ideas to help you look after yourself during lockdown. If you have any other wellbeing tips during self-isolation, please let us know!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eBe kind to yourself, take care, and stay safe!\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

Use the first sieve to strain the curd into the second sieve. Place the second sieve over a bowl to hold the cheese like the mould. This will give the final cheese it shape and texture, and the bowl beneath will catch any extra liquid.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eYou are collecting the cheese from the liquid; this can take some time and can require a little bit of technique while straining it through the sieve. It gets easier with time!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3e\x3cem\x3eTop Tip!\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/strong\x3e Your working station should look like this: a sieve to collect the curd, and a mould or any container for the cheese.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1588075593\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/Ingredients_3_ldnx3q.png\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eStep 6\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhen you have collected all the cheese, let the full mould or sieve rest in the fridge for about \x3csup\x3e6\x3c\/sup\x3e‚ÅÑ\x3csub\x3e7\x3c\/sub\x3e hours or overnight.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAt this stage your fresh cheese is still not firm, but tastes really good, so you can have an early taste. Don‚Äôt get put off by any vinegar after taste: it will disappear after it has fully rested.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eStep 7\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAfter enough time has passed, your cheese is ready to be eaten!

As we‚Äôve grown over the past two years, collective decision making has at times been difficult and slow.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTo address this, we are trialing a steering group of members, volunteers, staff, and trustees to replace the Member‚Äôs Decision Making Meetings for 3 months. This group will oversee short to medium-term strategy for the organisation and contribute to day to day decision making.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eYou can read the full steering group proposal \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/shrubcoop.us4.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=a28a538c55f3604b70c8e2cf3\x26id=1904351d8f\x26e=5dc338c9c3\x22\x3ehere.\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22who-will-be-part-of-the-steering-group\x22\x3eWho will be part of the steering group?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe steering group will comprise of:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e4 Volunteers or paid members (usually chosen at the Annual General Meeting)\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e3 Members of staff\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e3 Trustees\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22why-are-we-trying-this\x22\x3eWhy are we trying this?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOver the last 2 years, SHRUB has grown significantly. But it‚Äôs decision-making structure hasn‚Äôt changed much.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWith the size and scope of what we do, it‚Äôs become increasingly difficult to get effective decisions made quickly enough.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIn particular, the following problems have been identified:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eLack of engagement within our current decision-making system (low attendance at Decision Making Meetings, few comments on proposals).\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eLack of legitimate strategic development both long-term and short-term; currently, there is no long-term planning (except in funding applications) and short-term decisions largely made by staff or Trustees.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eLack of clarity in the roles and responsibilities of Trustees and staff, and a degree of overstretching in both.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22how-did-we-come-to-this-decision\x22\x3eHow did we come to this decision?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFor the past few months, the Governance and Policy working group have been closely analysing the patterns of our decision making and researching various different options. They have recommended a trial of a steering group of Members, Staff, and Trustees to address these issues and strengthen our decision making.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThis governance model was first showcased at our AGM in November 2019, discussed at a members‚Äô decision-making meeting on the 5th of March 2020, and was endorsed by the Trustees on the 20th of April 2020.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThis is a \x3cstrong\x3e3-month trial\x3c\/strong\x3e and the results will be discussed at a General Meeting of Members in July before we commit to this model in the long term.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3ch2 id=\x22are-you-interested-in-joining-the-steering-group\x22\x3eAre you interested in joining the steering group?\x3c\/h2\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22what-does-it-involve\x22\x3eWhat does it involve?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThis is an exciting opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to the short and medium-term strategy of SHRUB Coop. You will be involved in decisions that will directly affect the activities and projects we offer and help us to improve them over time. At the moment, many of these short term decisions have been taken by the staff and trustees; by joining the steering group you will bring a \x3cstrong\x3every valued perspective\x3c\/strong\x3e from the membership.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe steering group will \x3cstrong\x3emeet every 2 weeks\x3c\/strong\x3e, if you are unable to attend a session, you will be required to notify the group in advance. The time and location of these meetings will be agreed by members of the steering group to best accommodate everyone. Joining meetings remotely through Zoom is also possible.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eYou will need to attend an induction to be brought up to speed with the necessary information to help contribute to good and effective decision making. This will include SHRUB‚Äôs activities, the charity‚Äôs resources, and the current financial situation. You do not need to already have an in-depth understanding of these, and you will be aided by experienced staff and trustees in the group.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22how-do-i-join\x22\x3eHow do I join?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFirstly, you need to be an active member\x3cstrong\x3e*\x3c\/strong\x3e, either paid or as a volunteer.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eEmail us at \x3ca href=\x22mailto:hello@shrubcoop.org\x22\x3e**hello@shrubcoop.org **\x3c\/a\x3eto register your interest and let us know if you are a paid member or a volunteer member.

Thankfully, Jo from the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/working-groups\/swapshop\/\x22\x3eSwapshop\x3c\/a\x3e is here to guide you through how to do your own, step by step.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22so-where-to-start\x22\x3eSo, where to start?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe first step sounds easy but might take a while. Go through EVERYTHING in your wardrobe. Everything you wear everyday, everything you wear only for special occasions, and everything in between.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSort them into piles of:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eYour favorite things that you wear all the time\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eThings you wear sometimes and want to keep\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eThings you want to pass on\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eThings you need to repair\/ alter\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eThings you aren‚Äôt sure what to do with\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe idea of getting everything out at once lets you see if you have more or less of something that you need or don‚Äôt need. If you have two similar things but only ever wear one of them maybe pass the other on? Equally if there are things you wear all the time maybe it is worth having more than one.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22cut-off-date\x22\x3eCut off date\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFor anything you look at and think ‚ÄúI should wear that more‚Äù or things you say you wear but actually haven‚Äôt, a cut off date can be helpful. (It might be a good idea to decide what it will be before you start so that you don‚Äôt change your mind based on things you want to keep)\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe idea is, you pick a length of time, i.e. 1 year, and everything that you haven‚Äôt worn in over a year gets passed on. (A year goes through all the seasons so you can‚Äôt use the excuse of, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a summer thing‚Äù if it‚Äôs been over a year since you last wore it.)\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22ask-questions\x22\x3eAsk questions!\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe main part of doing a wardrobe audit is questioning yourself:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWhat things do you own that you don‚Äôt wear much?\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eDo you not wear them much because you don‚Äôt like them\/ don‚Äôt feel comfortable wearing them or just because you need a couple of things for fancier occasions?\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eDo you own 5 suits\/ fancy dresses even though you only go to one event where you need to wear that kind of clothing a year?\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWhat things do you wear the most? Do you need more of these or do you have enough?\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWhat is it that you love about the things you wear all the time? Are they a particular style, a particular color?\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eAre there some things that have been your favorite for so long that they now have holes? Can you patch these up or is it time to use the fabric for other things?\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eDoes it fit? If not do you want to keep it enough to alter it?\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22your-style\x22\x3eYour Style\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eYou might also want to have some questions about what your style is, and, what you want your style to be. This again can help you in deciding what things to keep and what other things you might want to get. This might be a good time to think about a one in one out rule. If you want to get something that fits a new style you want to have, maybe pass on something that you wore when you wanted a different style.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIt might also be that you need more things to wear for work if you got a new job in which case maybe this rule isn‚Äôt so relevant.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22sustainability\x22\x3eSustainability\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOften we see a lot of things about capsule wardrobes and having the fewest possible items. While this is certainly a good thing for some people, it is also worth thinking about the fact that a lot of the environmental footprint of clothes comes from washing and cleaning clothes. If having more clothes means that you can wash less frequently and have fuller washes when you do, it is not necessarily a bad thing to have a few more things than extreme minimalists.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22the-box\x22\x3eThe Box\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIf there are some things you are really promising yourself you will wear, a good test can be putting them in a box somewhere for a few months. If you don‚Äôt think about them at all while they are in the box, you will probably survive without them. (This can also have the added bonus of feeling like new clothes when you do find them again and start wearing them).\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22do-you-really-need-all-those-socks\x22\x3eDo you really need all those socks?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIf you are anything like me you have a lot of threadbare socks at the back of your wardrobe because you can‚Äôt bring yourself to throw them out for environmental reasons. There are hundreds of videos and articles online, all showing you what you can turn your old worn out socks into, so that, instead of just sitting there, they actually have a function again.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhat I am trying to say here is that there is always a better use for something than being at the back of your wardrobe. If it can be worn and loved by someone else, pass it on. If it can be used as fabric for another purpose, use it! The internet is an amazing place for coming up with uses for everything and anything.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22can-shrub-help\x22\x3eCan SHRUB Help?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/working-groups\/swapshop\/\x22\x3eSwapshop\x3c\/a\x3e is always happy to take donations of good quality clothing and bric-a-brac. There are sewing sessions every Tuesday and Thursday evening 5pm - 7pm with people to help in any way you need.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eUnfortunately, all of SHRUB‚Äôs activities are temporarily suspended at the moment but we will let you know as soon as they are back up and running.\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3ch5 id=\x22can-you-support-shrub-coop-with-a-donation\x22\x3eCan you support SHRUB Coop with a donation?\x3c\/h5\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTo do our part to help flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic, we‚Äôve temporarily closed all public activities until further notice. This is having a big impact on our income.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIf you are in a position to help us, could you \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/donate\/\x22\x3emake a donation to SHRUB Coop\x3c\/a\x3e?\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

Try these in your homes to help reduce your environmental footprint and relieve the stress of running out of the essentials and going to the shops!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eSoap Bars\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eStay at home and wash your hands! But what should you wash your hands with at home as hand sanitiser becomes a lucrative product on the market? According to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/uk.lush.com\/article\/soap-qa-daniel-campbell-product-inventor-cosmetic-scientist\x22\x3eLush‚Äôs ‚ÄòSoap Q\x26A‚Äô\x3c\/a\x3e, hand sanitiser on its own is not as good as soap, as soap is both antibacterial and will dislodge viruses from your hands. On top of this they are usually packaging free so there‚Äôs no extra waste, and a 100g bar of soap should last you up to 6 weeks!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eReusable Period Products\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe last thing you want right now is to find yourself out of tampons or sanitary towels and be faced with an empty shelf in the supermarket. Fear not, as there are a whole range of reusable period products on the market, from period pants, to reusable menstrual cups and cloth sanitary towels to meet everyone‚Äôs needs. These can be purchased in many supermarkets or online. Did you know that if you switched from single-use tampons to a reusable menstrual cup over just one year, you could \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.trialperiod.scot\/choose-reuse\x22\x3ereduce the associated carbon impacts of your period product by approximately 90%?\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eShampoo Bars\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eA year ago I made the swap from bottled shampoo to shampoo bars to reduce my plastic consumption and it was the best decision I ever made! They leave my hair feeling just as clean as before and last up to 6 months (depending on how much hair you have), all while making your shower experience more relaxing knowing you‚Äôre doing your bit for the planet. There are lots of shampoo bars on the market to fit all budgets. They are a staple product in most zero-waste shops, so find your local, and help support small businesses while you‚Äôre at it!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eLaundry Balls\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhether we‚Äôre in lockdown or not, there always seems to be a full washing basket to keep us busy! Lots of our SHRUB Coop Volunteers have already made the swap over to laundry balls, to cut down on the amount of plastic bottled detergent they have to buy. Laundry Balls use a range of different methods to clean your clothes, but mainly use pellets that attract dirt and grime. The major benefit is that they can be used for up to 70 washes before needing a refill.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eHomemade Cleaning Products\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSave some money and cut down on what you‚Äôre sending to landfill by building your supply of organic cleaning products.
