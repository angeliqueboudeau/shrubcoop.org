Try these in your homes to help reduce your environmental footprint and relieve the stress of running out of the essentials and going to the shops!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eSoap Bars\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eStay at home and wash your hands! But what should you wash your hands with at home as hand sanitiser becomes a lucrative product on the market? According to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/uk.lush.com\/article\/soap-qa-daniel-campbell-product-inventor-cosmetic-scientist\x22\x3eLush’s ‘Soap Q\x26A’\x3c\/a\x3e, hand sanitiser on its own is not as good as soap, as soap is both antibacterial and will dislodge viruses from your hands. On top of this they are usually packaging free so there’s no extra waste, and a 100g bar of soap should last you up to 6 weeks!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eReusable Period Products\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe last thing you want right now is to find yourself out of tampons or sanitary towels and be faced with an empty shelf in the supermarket. Fear not, as there are a whole range of reusable period products on the market, from period pants, to reusable menstrual cups and cloth sanitary towels to meet everyone’s needs. These can be purchased in many supermarkets or online. Did you know that if you switched from single-use tampons to a reusable menstrual cup over just one year, you could \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.trialperiod.scot\/choose-reuse\x22\x3ereduce the associated carbon impacts of your period product by approximately 90%?\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eShampoo Bars\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eA year ago I made the swap from bottled shampoo to shampoo bars to reduce my plastic consumption and it was the best decision I ever made! They leave my hair feeling just as clean as before and last up to 6 months (depending on how much hair you have), all while making your shower experience more relaxing knowing you’re doing your bit for the planet. There are lots of shampoo bars on the market to fit all budgets. They are a staple product in most zero-waste shops, so find your local, and help support small businesses while you’re at it!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eLaundry Balls\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhether we’re in lockdown or not, there always seems to be a full washing basket to keep us busy! Lots of our SHRUB Coop Volunteers have already made the swap over to laundry balls, to cut down on the amount of plastic bottled detergent they have to buy. Laundry Balls use a range of different methods to clean your clothes, but mainly use pellets that attract dirt and grime. The major benefit is that they can be used for up to 70 washes before needing a refill.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eHomemade Cleaning Products\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSave some money and cut down on what you’re sending to landfill by building your supply of organic cleaning products. You’d be amazed at what you can do with some distilled white vinegar, baking soda and lemon juice! You can find plenty of recipes online, but if you fancy having it all in one place you can purchase handy guides like \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/blackwells.co.uk\/bookshop\/product\/9781440572517?gC=5a105e8b\x26gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsO3zi9fd6AIVh63tCh2Meg_fEAQYASABEgLhVvD_BwE\x22\x3e‘The Organically Clean Home’.\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eReusable Toilet Paper\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAnd finally, the biggest topic of conversation this lockdown…toilet paper! This wouldn’t be a complete list without mentioning reusable toilet paper. It won’t be for everyone, but if you have collected everything else on this list, why not give it a go? Some top tips include:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWe only recommend using reusable toilet paper for a #1.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eMake your toilet paper using an old t-shirt, cutting it up the same size as the sheets on the rolls we’re used to.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eStore used sheets in a separate container in the bathroom.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eUrine is sterile, so you can happily wash your toilet paper on the eco, 30 degrees setting.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eVoila! Your toilet paper is ready to use again.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe hope this list gives you a starting point to help you buy less, waste less and reduce your environmental footprint, during lockdown and beyond. If you have any other recommendations for eco-friendly swaps that have made lockdown life easier, let us know in the comments.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTake care and stay safe!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3ePhoto credit: SHRUB Coop, Marco Verch (Flickr), Wallpaper Flare.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch5 id=\x22can-you-support-shrub-coop-with-a-donation\x22\x3eCan you support SHRUB Coop with a donation?\x3c\/h5\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTo do our part to help flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve temporarily closed all public activities until further notice.

Our team is small but our vision is vast! We’ve been working to pick up on the work of welfare working groups past to build and grow into a once-again fully functional, self-sustaining working group. We’ll now, hopefully, be able to work with all other groups and individuals at SHRUB to promote the health and wellbeing of all members, staff, and volunteers.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOur mission statement is:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3e“To ensure the mental, physical and emotional wellbeing of staff, volunteers and members of the coop. This will include creating accessible welfare policies, caring for wellbeing through workshops and drop in sessions and arbitrating conflicts and complaints.”\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3ePractically, this means we’ll be hosting meetings, drop-ins and various workshops throughout the year, open to anyone who feels up for attending. We’ll also be managing the \x3ca href=\x22mailto:welfare@shrubcoop.org\x22\x3ewelfare@shrubcoop.org\x3c\/a\x3e email for anyone needing any kind of support, and we’ll be taking feedback on the running of SHRUB more generally. We’re still looking for more volunteers to help with the running of this group. The tasks are diverse and can include collecting resources, hosting drop-ins, talking to other volunteers and external organisations, or fulfilling any of your own welfare-related ideas!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIf you have a suggestion, grievance, or concern; are needing help or resources; or feel like contacting welfare for any other reason please feel free to email \x3ca href=\x22mailto:welfare@shrubcoop.org\x22\x3ewelfare@shrubcoop.org\x3c\/a\x3e or message any of the team individually.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSo far this team includes some familiar faces and a new volunteer, all equally enthused by the well-being of all folk at SHRUB:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eSiri:\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1578330678\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/welfare_pic_wlmvhc.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eI work full-time at SHRUB as the CCF Project Coordinator, which means I’m involved in a lot of the work behind the scenes, from funding to HR, monitoring and welfare work.

Oh, and we don’t charge extra for vegan milks (tell your friends)!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe’ve set ourselves an ambitious goal too, we’re aiming for our café to be zero waste! That means \x3cstrong\x3eno disposable coffee cups\x3c\/strong\x3e and working to eliminate plastic packaging from our supply chain. We can’t promise we’ll be 100% zero waste from the start, but we can promise that every choice and decision we make will be consciously made to eventually get us there. And that’s where these blog posts come in! Throughout our journey to becoming a zero waste café, we’ll be documenting the challenges and triumphs along the way to share with other businesses and home cooks. How do you make the perfect plastic-free panini from start to finish? We’re not sure yet, but we soon will, and we’ll share the tips and tricks here.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSo there you go, it’s written in a blog post now so it must be happening. We’d like you to join us on our journey towards zero waste and we’ll be asking for your ideas each step of the way. It’s not going to be easy, and we won’t always get it right, but we want to have an honest conversation about waste.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe can’t wait to start this journey and feeding you all delicious food along the way. Here we go 2020!\x3c\/p\x3e\n"
