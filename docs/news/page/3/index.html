  var str = "\x3cp\x3eAs a child we’ve all either handed something on (or down!) or been the recipient of a hand-me-down item ourselves – continuing the useful life of the garment and saving families some money in the process.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOne thing that can’t be denied about children is that they keep growing, and a lot of the time their clothes are far from worn out by the time they are outgrown. It makes good sense to pass them on to someone who is the right size to make use of them. Many of these hand-me-downs happen between siblings, or extended family, but just as often they happen between friends, neighbours or even school communities.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe all know that some clothes last longer than others, and this becomes very clear when children have climbed, scrambled and played in them. Repeated washing can take its toll on poorly made garments but some of the best can be in circulation for years before they wear out. For example, Boden \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.boden.co.uk\/en-gb\/sustainability#Footer\x22\x3enow put extra space on the ‘This coat belongs to’ label\x3c\/a\x3e to accommodate four different names, encouraging their customers to pass it on again and again!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eHere are some tips to get the most from every hand-me-down:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eBefore you pass it on, is there a sibling in your house that could wear it in the next couple of years? Wash the garment and store it somewhere safe and dry until you need it again. Kids clothes – especially for younger children – don’t quickly go out of fashion.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eIs it fit for reuse? Nobody will thank you for torn and stained kids’ clothes! Find another use for them – upcycling, giving to an animal shelter or finding a textile recycling point using \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.recyclenow.com\/\x22\x3erecyclenow.com\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eAsk your friends and neighbours with children if they could make use of some kids’ clothes and remind them to pass them on again once they no longer need them.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eIf you have no clear route for your hand-me-downs, there are a number of groups on social media where you can advertise bundles e.g. “Clothing bundle for boy\/girl age 3-4” You can offer them for sale or for free.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eFor school uniform, ask your child’s school if there is a ‘Nearly New’ sale that you can donate clothes to. If not, why not start one yourself or suggest it to the PTA? The clothing donations can then be sold on at low prices to other families, with the proceeds topping up school funds.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOf course, hand-me-downs needn’t stop once you’re an adult! We can apply a lot of the same advice above to adult clothes. Nearly New school sales can be replaced with clothes swapping parties (sometimes known as schwopping), which are a fun way to give a piece of clothing a new lease of life and to refresh your wardrobe.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1621599331\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/C_dungarees_2_zsvqhz.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

  var str = "\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1621282217\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/nbm_mhjmol.png\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eNational Bike Month takes place every May and aims to highlight the many benefits of cycling for individuals and the environment, encouraging regular cyclists and newcomers alike to find more ways to get out on their bikes and make the most of this sustainable form of transport. While we have previously looked at some of the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/getting-onto-the-saddle\/\x22\x3ecommon concerns around cycling in cities\x3c\/a\x3e, this National Bike Month we want to focus on how cycling can be used to mobilise politicians to commit to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.bicycling.com\/news\/a20004895\/bicycles-can-be-a-huge-part-of-combating-climate-change\/\x22\x3egreater environmental action\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eEdinburgh has set itself the ambitious target of becoming \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.edinburgh.gov.uk\/futureedinburgh\x22\x3ecarbon-neutral by 2030\x3c\/a\x3e, a goal which will require significant transformation of infrastructures and behaviours in the city. As it stands, only \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.edinburgh.gov.uk\/downloads\/file\/26121\/bike-life-2017\x22\x3e9% of Edinburgh residents cycle on a regular basis\x3c\/a\x3e, and the UK as a whole has one of the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.cyclinguk.org\/statistics\x22\x3elowest cycling rates\x3c\/a\x3e in Europe. Why is this? Factors such as weather conditions can be apportioned some of the blame, but unfortunately one of the most likely culprits is the lack of sufficient cycling infrastructure in UK cities. With cars, buses and trams receiving priority on the road, cyclists are often forced to fight for space on the road, and where cycle lanes do exist, they are often poorly-maintained and inconsistent. Comparing Edinburgh to a city like Amsterdam or Copenhagen, the very configuration of the roads has a\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/cities\/2016\/jan\/05\/where-world-most-cycle-friendly-city-amsterdam-copenhagen\x22\x3e profound influence on an individual’s decision to take up cycling\x3c\/a\x3e: in the latter cities, bikes receive priority on the road and are separated from car traffic on wide and well-maintained cycle lanes. These cities are structured around green transport which explicitly favours cycling over other modes of transport, thus making cycling a more efficient and attractive form of transport.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThere are many lessons that Edinburgh can learn from these more bike-friendly cities, and cyclists (both old and new) will play a key role in shaping how Edinburgh designs its carbon-neutral projects. Activism and political mobilisation were key components in establishing Amsterdam as the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/cities\/2015\/may\/05\/amsterdam-bicycle-capital-world-transport-cycling-kindermoord\x22\x3e‘bicycle capital of the world’\x3c\/a\x3e, and so the same can be done in Edinburgh. In light of the recent election, the cycling community must come together to push for better cycling facilities and incentives, holding leaders accountable for their promises to make Edinburgh a more sustainable city in the face of climate change. With so many environmental benefits to cycling, including cleaner air, reduced emissions and more liveable cities, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.cyclinguk.org\/current-campaigns\x22\x3ewww.cyclinguk.org\/current-campaigns\x3c\/a\x3e outlines a number of ways to get involved in campaigning for better bicycle infrastructure in order to bring about a sustained change in how people get around their cities. This National Bike Month, while out cycling, why not try and make notes of where there are opportunities to maximise the roads for cyclists - you can then send your suggestions to local politicians and be a part of the change for a more sustainable and bicycle-friendly Edinburgh. And of course, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/working-groups\/wee-spoke-hub\/\x22\x3eWee Spoke Hub\x3c\/a\x3e are here for all your bicycle needs, from advice on getting started to providing bike maintenance services. The Shrub community is the perfect place to start the cycling revolution and design a more environmentally-friendly city for everyone.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

  var str = "\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1618912045\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/jr-harris-afVzV0gvnpY-unsplash_ygp7rp.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3ePhoto: JR Harris - Unsplash.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eBased on UK Government statistics, it is likely that over 400 000 tonnes of used\/second-hand textiles are exported each year. They are sent abroad, labelled as aid and sold on in textile markets for very low prices.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eAre foreign textile markets not a good thing?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAt first, foriegn textile markets sound like a great idea. We are sending clothes to countries where they will be reused and told that they go to people who may not otherwise be able to buy their own clothes. These markets, however, have been associated with destroying local textile economies. The second hand clothing enters these countries as ‘aid’ and is often not taxed, meaning that these clothes are incredibly cheap and undercut the prices of things produced locally. This means that people no longer buy locally produced items and local companies can no longer survive. In Akan, the most widely spoken language in Ghana, these clothes are referred to as “Obroni Wawu” which roughly translates as “dead white man’s clothes”.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe number of items sent to these markets is also problematic. According to the American NGO the OR Foundation, before the pandemic, 15 million items were arriving in Ghana each week. For a country with a population of 31 million, this is one new garment per person every 2 weeks. It is crazy to assume that all of these items can be used and are genuinely needed. According to the same NGO, around 40% of the items that arrive in Ghana end up discarded. Given that there are concerns with microplastics polluting the areas around landfill sites as synthetic textiles start to degrade, we, as rich western countries, are using foreign textile markets as a way of pushing the problem of soil and water pollution onto other countries rather than dealing with it in the countries where these clothes are worn and used.Considering that there are already social justice concerns around the rights of garment workers, the fact that we are now exploiting other countries at both ends of the supply chain cannot, in any way, be considered fair.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWhy keep going?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eLast year, there were some discussions of Kenya stopping its ‘mitumba’ second hand clothing market due to concerns that it was having negative impacts on the local economy and local business. It has now been announced that this will not happen. The USA have threatened to remove Kenya from the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) for ‘violating safe trade’ between the USA and Kenya. This is effectively blackmailing Kenya into continuing to act as a waste dump for the USA. This was not an idle threat, the same thing has already happened with Rwanda where they were not allowed to be a part of AGOA as they wanted to increase the taxes on second hand clothing to give their own textile markets a chance. If we want to say that we are helping other countries, we should be doing it on their terms,not forcing them to take more textiles than they can ever use, a large proportion of which end up in their landfill sites instead of ours.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eIs there a solution?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs well as pointing out problems, we want to highlight things that can be done to change them.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTextile recycling: It is still hard to find much information on Textile Recycling, however it appears that less than 1% of second hand textiles are being recycled in the EU. Researching textile recycling could help us to deal with clothes at the end of their lives, as well as giving us a more sustainable and local source of fibres for creating new clothes.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eDealing with this problem in our own countries: I once suggested to someone who works for an environmental organisation that we should stop sending clothes abroad and their response was to ask what we would do and how we would cope with it all. To me, this is exactly the point. While we continue to send so much abroad, it is a problem that we do not have to see or deal with. If we stopped sending so much to other countries, we would be forced to confront the issue of our overconsumption and develop ways of dealing with these textiles rather than ignoring them. There are many people within Scotland and the UK who cannot afford new clothing and who could be supported by these clothes being given to local groups.There are also many people who are happy to buy second hand clothing or turn old clothes into new items that can be reused such as the Ian Snow Scrap Scrap Scheme.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe can still recognise that as a country with a lot of wealth, we may be able to help people in other countries by sending supplies abroad, however this should only only be done if things are asked for so that we send over things that are genuinely needed and each country or group is in control of what and how much they take.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

The promise of a ‘return to normalcy’ is alluring. There is a comfort in the familiar. But a return to normalcy is not what the world needs now. Instead, the world needs transformation, and this Earth Day, we are focusing on how to Restore our Earth.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs lockdowns brought the world to a halt, nature made a comeback away from the interference of human activity. We saw images of the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/av\/world-europe-51943104\x22\x3eclearest waters Venice had seen\x3c\/a\x3e in centuries, heard the good news about endangered species such as the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-africa-55889766\x22\x3eRhino building back their populations\x3c\/a\x3e, and we even saw videos of \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/youtu.be\/TUkJE_MC3eA\x22\x3epenguins wandering the streets of Cape Town\x3c\/a\x3e during the lockdown. So entrancing were these visions of resilience in the natural world, that a new documentary depicting the effects of lockdown on the environment, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, is due to be released on Apple\x2b, entitled ‘\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XswV_yqPq28\x22\x3eThe Year Earth Changed\x3c\/a\x3e’. And while it is problematic to suggest that the separation of humans from nature is the key to restoring the earth (this has been the founding logic for \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/global-development\/2016\/aug\/28\/exiles-human-cost-of-conservation-indigenous-peoples-eco-tourism\x22\x3edispossessing indigenous communities of their land\x3c\/a\x3e, as just one argument against it), the lockdowns highlighted just how overactive the human domination of nature has become.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eA return to normalcy means a return to ‘business-as-usual’ models which entails high levels of pollution, resource extraction and deforestation in the pursuit of profit. The very systems that \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/gen-z-climate-activists-biden-climate-change-school-strike-2021-4\x22\x3eclimate activists are fighting to deconstruct\x3c\/a\x3e - capitalism, (neo-) colonialism and the patriarchy - are the ones inherent in the ‘business-as-usual’ model. However, this Earth Day, activists are challenging this normalcy and calling for a new plan to keep nature in harmony with humans. Over the course of three days, Earth Day activists will be running events including a virtual youth summit, a climate literacy workshop, and a number of panels and performances to encourage people around the world to demand more effective climate action across all sectors and scales. To see what events may interest you, check out the website \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.earthday.org\/earth-day-2021\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eEarth Day 2021 is particularly important, as the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2021\/mar\/26\/joe-biden-climate-change-virtual-summit\x22\x3eBiden administration is hosting a climate summit \x3c\/a\x3ewith leaders from across the world, marking his commitment to climate action after restoring the US as a party to the Paris Agreement. During this summit, he is expected to announce more ambitious carbon emission reduction targets in the US, and discussions around strategies for a ‘just transition’ are anticipated. The coordination of climate action from the grassroots level, up to the international arena, shows the momentum behind climate activism, and this Earth Day, we encourage you to celebrate this achievement!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eEarth Day is a great opportunity to connect with the climate justice community and learn more about how others are committing to this cause. Aside from the events hosted on \x3ca href=\x22http:\/\/earthday.org\x22\x3eearthday.org\x3c\/a\x3e, our very own \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.tickettailor.com\/events\/lisaheywood\/495160\x22\x3eSHRUB Coop ceilidh\x3c\/a\x3e will be taking place on Saturday 24th April, promising a night of dancing, music and poetry. What better way to feel connected in a pandemic celebration of climate activism?! For those of us less-inclined to get up and dance, there are plenty of other ways to engage with Earth Day. In fact, far from insisting on the separation of humans from nature, this Earth Day, why don’t you find a way to get out and immerse yourself in the natural environment? Whether it’s watching the sunset from Carlton Hill, going for a dip in Portobello, taking a stroll along the Water of Leith Walkway, or simply cycling through The Meadows, Edinburgh has no shortage of nature for you to enjoy. Connecting with our surroundings is a powerful act of restoration for ourselves, and reminds us of why we are working towards a world without waste in the first place.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

One need only read our recent article series ‘A Less-Than-Cheerful Assessment of the Fashion Industry’ (\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/a-less-than-cheerful-assessment-of-the-fashion-industry-part-i\/\x22\x3ePart I \x3c\/a\x3eand \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/a-less-than-cheerful-assessment-of-the-fashion-industry-part-ii-2\/\x22\x3ePart II\x3c\/a\x3e) to understand just how many issues the fashion industry is hiding behind its glamorous catwalks. However, Fashion Revolution is not in the business of shaming individuals in the pursuit of systemic change. Instead, the focus is on educating people on how to change their attitudes towards fashion and encouraging everyone to demand higher standards from fashion conglomerates. So how do we stay optimistic and stylish at the same time?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe Fashion Revolution website offers a number of different ways to engage in fashion activism. Given that the industry carries a number of concerns, from human rights, and \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/thegreenhubonline.com\/2018\/10\/21\/why-the-fast-fashion-industry-is-a-feminist-issue\/\x22\x3ewomen’s rights in particular\x3c\/a\x3e, to environmental violations and unsustainable resource use, the two hashtags #WhoMadeMyClothes and #WhatsInMyClothes challenge fashion brands to be transparent about how their products are designed and manufactured. This in turn encourages them to address the exploitative practices in their supply chain and contributes to the fight for change in the industry where brands respond to consumer demands.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe hashtag #WhoMadeMyFabric is also presented as a means to promote justice across all areas of the supply chain, not just in the manufacturing stage. Before work begins in the garment factories, a \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.the-sustainable-fashion-collective.com\/2017\/02\/27\/environmental-ethical-issues-production-natural-fabrics-fibres\/\x22\x3elitany of environmental abuses have occurred \x3c\/a\x3ein the production of fabrics, and in many cases, the farmers growing these resources are \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fairtrade.org.uk\/Farmers-and-Workers\/Cotton\/About-Cotton\/\x22\x3enot paid a fair price\x3c\/a\x3e for their labour. During Fashion Revolution Week, social media is an important tool to spotlight these issues and mobilise people across the globe to consider the implications of how their clothes were made.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFashion Revolution also encourages consumers to get in touch with brands directly, either through social media message channels, or writing an email, in order to ask questions about the policies in place to protect workers and the environment. As the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/bylinetimes.com\/2020\/07\/14\/modern-slavery-is-never-out-of-fashion-child-labour-in-the-clothing-industry\/\x22\x3esecond most at-risk industry for modern slavery\x3c\/a\x3e, it is again the pressure from consumers that can hold companies accountable for their complicity in unsafe and unjust business practices and usher in reform.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThere will be a number of educational events hosted during Fashion Revolution Week too, with the schedule available \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fashionrevolution.org\/ecwd_calendar\/all-events\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e. These events will take place all over the world, spotlighting different issues and workshopping potential solutions to the crises of the fashion industry. The \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fashionopenstudio.com\x22\x3eFashion Open Studio \x3c\/a\x3eis also a great chance to see the innovation occurring from within the industry itself, connecting consumers with designers and providing unique insight into the potential for transformation in fashion.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOf course, fashion activism is not an isolated movement that ends at the end of Fashion Revolution Week. These questions and actions are meaningful forms to engage in collective action, but we have the chance to carry these lessons through to our everyday lives too. By quitting fast fashion, or at least dramatically reducing our reliance on it, we can help to fight human rights injustices and reduce our environmental impact, and there are numerous tools out there to help with this transition. Focusing on keeping our clothes for longer helps to eliminate textile waste going to landfill, and shopping secondhand, renting clothing or just swapping with friends and family means that less resources are required to shake up our wardrobes, further protecting the environment. Here at Shrub Coop, we’re here to help you on this journey.

According to the CBI (the Confederation of British Industry) there is a loss of approximately $100 billion of materials per year. With these issues in mind, something needs to change. Much has been said about the role of rewearing, repairing, reselling and repurposing your old clothing, but what happens when your stockings get the inevitable run? What about socks that can no longer be darned? What about a fast fashion tee-shirt that has been worn three times and has warped into an asymmetrical fit with unravelling seams? Our wardrobes and linen cupboards are full of items that, realistically, can no longer be reworn, repaired, resold or repurposed.The notion of throwing these languishing items into landfill should fill us with a sense of unease. So, if we take landfill out of the equation, what is our next step?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWhat is Textile Recycling?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe idea of textile recycling is to take old garments, pull them apart into the original fibres, and re-make them into something new. This would mean that what is currently a waste product (old clothes) would become the source for new clothes, as well as reducing the production of new textiles and all of the resources required to make them.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWhat is the current situation?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThere are many sustainability programmes that have been launched by fashion producers, however the amount of textiles dropped off to recycling centres that actually end up being recycled is low. The Centre for the Promotion of Imports from developing countries, though it does not give a source, use the figure of approximately 50% of collected textiles being reused with 50% of collected textiles being recycled. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation created an infographic showing that of all textiles produced globally in 2015, less than 1% get recycled into something new and 73% got landfilled or incinerated.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWhat is the need for Textile Recycling?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs you may have seen in our recent blog posts, there is a massive problem with there being too many textiles in the world and many, many issues with how they are produced.

This all sounds really great, however, what does it really mean?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe 2020 H\x26M Group Sustainability Performance Report unhelpfully refers to ‘recycled or sustainably sourced materials’ as a single category, meaning that it is difficult to work out what material is actually recycled rather than just ‘sustainably sourced’. There is also a lack of clarity regarding exactly what can be recycled, what happens to items that cannot be recycled, and what it actually means to be ‘sustainable sourced’. There are many places that claim that it is still impossible to recycle blends of cotton and polyester so why is H\x26M claiming that it is possible or why are other places not aware of this despite this technology having opened in 2018?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe question still lingers: what happened to the old Asics trainers that I put into the textile recycling bin? Was my attempt at recycling the same as having put these trainers into landfill? The H\x26M Group do note that only 5.8% of materials used in ’commercial goods’ are recycled and commit to the use of 30% recycled textiles by 2025. Given that there is such a massive amount of second hand textiles readily available, why is this number not higher? Surely if they have the technology ready, they should be aiming to make at least more than 50% of their garments out of recycled material?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIn a review of the textile industry, Piribauer and Barti (2019) stated that when the complexity of a textile composition decreases, it will be easier to recycle. Maybe the solution is to change the way we make any new textiles, to make them out of as few different fibre types as possible so that we know they will be recyclable at the end of their life?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWhat does this mean for an organisation like Shrub?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAt the moment, it still doesn’t look like there are any textile recycling schemes that we can access from SHRUB Coop, and none of the systems that currently exist are particularly effective (although if you know of anything, please get in touch). This creates an opportunity to work with other organisations, identify UK producers and gather information about how different textile producers and sellers work.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

Photo: Munir Uz Zaman\/AFP\/Getty Images.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOn April 24th 2013, the hidden realities of the fast fashion industry came to light when 1,138 garment workers were killed in the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2013\/jun\/06\/bangladesh-factory-building-collapse-community\x22\x3eworst industrial disaster\x3c\/a\x3e ever witnessed in Bangladesh. Rana Plaza, located outside the capital city of Dhaka, was home to five clothing factories making clothes for fast fashion brands including Primark, Benetton and Walmart. When workers arrived that morning, many refused to go in when they saw the cracks in the building, yet \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/global-development\/2018\/apr\/24\/bangladeshi-police-target-garment-workers-union-rana-plaza-five-years-on\x22\x3emanagers insisted they enter the building.\x3c\/a\x3e In the space of ninety seconds, the entire plaza crumbled to the ground.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fashionrevolution.org\/about\/\x22\x3eFashion Revolution\x3c\/a\x3e was founded after this deadly disaster to bring together activists across the globe who are demanding greater human rights protection, environmental awareness and improved accountability and transparency within the fashion industry. Every year, Fashion Revolution week occurs to mark the anniversary of the Rana Plaza collapse and renew efforts to improve the standards of the fashion industry. The movement focuses on raising awareness of the injustices occurring in global fashion, with the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes used to encourage consumers to consider the human cost of their clothing. When production takes place so far removed from the shores where the clothes are purchased, it is easy to feel disconnected from those involved in the garment industry, but Fashion Revolution week aims to bridge that divide and unite both consumers and workers in demanding justice within the fashion industry.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWith its focus on mobilising members of society to demand higher standards of fast fashion companies, Fashion Revolution has been instrumental in bringing about positive changes such as greater transparency practices amongst fashion brands. Every year, more and more companies are agreeing to share their suppliers and factories so that consumers know how and where their clothing was made. Dividing their work into three main sections, Fashion Revolution is engaged in advocating for industry change, policy change and cultural change. These three distinct areas target concerns around the environmental cost of fashion, the improvement of workers’ rights in the garment industry, and a change in consumer habits towards fashion. By consuming less fast fashion and preserving the clothing we own for longer, we can actively challenge the fashion industry and reduce our environmental impact. At Shrub, we are marking Fashion Revolution Week by having \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CNp8kAbKb8z\/\x22\x3ea social media challenge\x3c\/a\x3e where people share interesting stories about their second-hand clothing, celebrating the history of the garment. As well as this we will be sharing \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/shrubcoop\x22\x3esocial media\x3c\/a\x3e and \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/news\/\x22\x3eblog posts\x3c\/a\x3e giving you more information about the fast fashion industry and how you can avoid it. Fast fashion thrives on the constant renewal of our wardrobes, chasing the latest designs and disposing of our clothing in less-than-sustainable manners. This is driving the crises in the fashion industry, but Fashion Revolution Week provides a way for us to reconsider our relationship with our clothes and demand meaningful change in the fashion industry.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

  var str = "\x3cp\x3eIt is difficult to concisely express and divide up the main problems in fashion. Let me name five big ones that cannot be looked past. All these issues overlap and sometimes contribute to each other. The topics are listed in no particular order as all of these are important.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1617623699\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/hannah-morgan-ycVFts5Ma4s-unsplash_svcdu5.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eGlobal systemic racism and the connection to slavery\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eLike all industries and institutions, the fashion system operates within the boundaries of the global trade system often based on colonialist trade routes and hierarchies upholding to this day neo-colonial rule. Disproportionately women of colour carry the burden of producing clothes for little or no pay. India, China, Bangladesh are often the origins of our clothes as we all know when we check the labels. This does not mean categorically all garments from those countries are produced in bad working conditions or under harassment, but it is undeniable how many of them are.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAn example: Cotton is known to be the fibre with the biggest connection to the era of slavery in America. The cotton produced in America during the Industrial Revolution accounted up to 2\/3rd of the world’s cotton production and has contributed massively to the economic power of the US. But unfortunately, it cannot be said that production now happens under any more ethical conditions. It is estimated that about 1\/5th of all cotton products come from the Xinjiang region where Uighurs are held in internment camps. And the fashion industry openly admits to not being able to make sure that the cotton they use do not come from there as the supply chains are often too complex to track. But this is unfortunately just the worst of the worst as examples of child labour and workers’ rights abuses are widespread in different production locations and fibre types.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe answer here is: Think local and look out for short supply chains. Irish linen and British wool are the examples of materials grown in closer proximity. Small companies focusing on only a few products\/ materials are better able to track their supply chains.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIf this is not possible due to price or accessibility, buying second hand is always a good option as these garments have already been produced.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eMicroplastics\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOnly little research has been done on this issue compared to the scale of the problem facing us. Microplastics have been found everywhere on earth now from the Mariana Trench, the peaks of the Himalayas to the top of the polar regions. Broken fibres of synthetic clothing seem to be the biggest culprit when it comes to this pollutant. They travel both through marine environments as well as by wind and are settling in all manner of organisms, with analysis still wondering if they are carcinogenic or what other damages they may cause. As this is a fairly newly discovered problem and as most contributors to this problem are private companies, there has been very little action taken to reduce the output of synthetic fibres or and no talk of responsibility on how to clean the ecosystems up. (In 2015 plastic fibres accounted for about 61% of the global fibre output).\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe answer is here: There are now many products that you can use when washing your clothes, from bags to put all of your clothes inside to ‘eggs’ that catch the tiny particles. The aim of these is to trap and contain microfibres before they enter the wastewater system so that they can be disposed of in a safe way. Trying to buy natural fibre clothing wherever possible will also help, both by reducing the number of micro plastics you release in washes but also by showing fashion brands that natural materials are sought after.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWaste management\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIn general clothes are designed in the Global North and then are made by people in the Global South are then sent to the West to be “consumed”. Once used and disposed of they are then sent back into the producing nations, either impacting the local fashion industry if resold or polluting water and grounds if put on waste tips. These mostly poorer nations get no support\/ funding or technologies to process the waste properly (if processes even exist for the clothing produced).\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eRoughly 15 million second-hand garments are exported into Ghana’s Katamanto market in a country of 30 million people weekly. They are sold on as well but 40% end up on enormous waste tips or along the Gulf of Guinea.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWithin production and disposal there are many processes requiring toxic chemicals for dyeing or dissolving of fibres as well as using local water sources and creating emissions. The companies contracting the factories have very little control over how much of the pollutants used escape into the environment or how diligent they are about keeping their workers safe from these pollutants as it is often such complex supply chains with so many different parts that it would be impossible to check. With the number of styles these companies produce, and all the small parts needed (Yarns, zips, buttons etc) in different colourways to track and check regularly that all their producers are complying while being strewn across the planet is not achievable.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe answer is here: By only buying the clothes we really need and borrowing, swapping and buying from charity shops wherever possible, we will reduce the number of items of clothing in circulation so that there is no longer a need for such massive second hand markets. This will allow local textile markets to grow which will also help to improve transparency in supply chains.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrying to buy clothes from companies that use more natural dyeing processes or supporting campaigns and encouraging brands to reduce water pollution can also help. There are probably already some campaigns out there that you can join in with.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eDepletion of soil due to overuse and pesticides\/ insecticides and monocultures\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThis is a problem in which fashion is not necessarily one of the main culprits but is certainly having an impact. Most of the trees grown for viscose, Tencel or bamboo fibres (this includes is the fsbc-labelled garments) are grown in monocultures resulting in a greater need to use insecticides\/ pesticides as there is a higher risk of infestations from funghi or insects damaging the crop. On the other hand this results in less cutting down of trees surrounding the trees that they want to have felled, as it would be like in a conventional forest so there is no ideal way to solve this problem.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eCompanies such as Monstanto and Bayer have made a huge amount of money on seeds and have, for example, exported American cotton plants to large parts of India as well as other cotton producing countries. Not ideally suited for the local soil these also require more pesticides\/ insecticides and cotton is a greedy plant soaking up the soil’s nutrients and water. The film True Cost also shows the impact pesticides have on the health and bodily developments of children in rural areas.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe answer is here: The fashion industry could, in fact, help with enriching the ground the fibres grow on. Plants such as Flax (Linen) and Hemp replenish the nitrogen storage of the soil and bind carbon. Less water and pesticides are required (both of them are considered weeds as they spread and grow faster and so higher annual yields are possible on the same surface area). When buying new, keep an eye out for linen, hemp, or recycled cotton. Some of the more ethical fashion brands may be able to ensure that any plants in their supply chain are grown in better conditions that are less damaging to the natural environment.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eProduction outstripping demand by far\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFashion is one of the industries in which the products are not seen as an investment but rather as entertainment and its purchase to pass the time on a weekend or online. Huge marketing machines make customers want different entire wardrobes to aspire to a different lifestyle or keep up with trends of friend groups. I think this is all nothing new to any person seeing a shopping street on any day of the week (even during a pandemic). But the numbers are heart-breaking; more than 150 billion garments are produced each year (that makes 20 new garments for every person on the planet ANNUALLY). If you consider how many people around the world and within the UK cannot afford to buy these it means that large amounts of clothes will either sit in people’s wardrobes unworn, or are never sold and get incinerated\/or sit in landfill.This makes fashion the second largest polluter in the world (with oil being the biggest one, but looking at fashion we also contribute to the extraction of oil which is often not calculated)\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe answer is here: Choosing to swap clothes, share with friends, buying second hand and changing the way we use and value clothes will force the market to change. If we can show that there is no longer a demand for fast fashion, companies will have to change in order to be profitable.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIt is difficult to condense these issues into a short list but do find me on \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/martalynch_projects\/\x22\x3eInstagram \x3c\/a\x3eand ask more questions or links to resources.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFor some more Instagram inspiration on these topics, have a look at \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/social-media-accounts-we-recommend-if-you-like-sustainable-and-ethical-fashion\/\x22\x3ethis blog post\x3c\/a\x3e!\x3c\/p\x3e\n"
