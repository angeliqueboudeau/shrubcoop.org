Our last lot of funding ran till March 2020 when the global Coronavirus Pandemic closed lots of community-led initiatives down.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIn September 2020 we were awarded a grant of £2,000 to offer a \x3cstrong\x3eFREE Cycle Repair Scheme\x3c\/strong\x3e - aiming to help people “get on their bike” again.

  var str = "\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1605029458\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/everyday_cycling_skillshare_zaluv2.png\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIt’s great to see so many people embracing cycling as a way of getting around recently. Cycling has a bit of a reputation in the UK for being the reserve of sports enthusiasts, wearing the distinctive lycra outfits that we see on TV in sports events. However, in other parts of the world cycling is much more part of the day-to-day fabric of life - just another transport option that can be much cheaper and more convenient than public transport or a private car.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThis second view of cycling is how I have always related to it – something I think of as “everyday cycling”. I’m not really a competitive person, so the idea of getting a new best time doesn’t make my heart race. For me cycling is a great way to get around the city as well as weaving some outdoor time and physical activity into my day without it seeming like a chore.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eI used to cycle to secondary school when I was younger but after moving to a hilly city I had a break of several years. Later I moved to Bristol, which has great cycling infrastructure, and picked it back up again as a cheap and quick way to get to work. I found it took me a little while to find the best route, and where to find out information about how to store and maintain my bike. Later I moved to Edinburgh and the same questions came up once again. I didn’t know who to ask so I ended up working it out from scratch!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSometimes it can be hard to know where to find information and resources about cycling, and not everyone knows someone who they can ask…but what if there was a place you could go to meet other “everyday cyclists” to ask all those questions? Well, we’ve created a space to do just that! We are welcoming new and everyday cyclists to join us in a fortnightly skill-share where we can help you find the information you need to get where you want to go on two wheels!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eJoin us online for our “Everyday Cycling Skill-share” at 5:30-6:30pm on Mondays on the following dates:\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3e1st February - Carrying stuff while cycling.

We are particularly looking for people with experience in the fields of \x3cstrong\x3eCommunity Development, Finance, HR and Fundraising\x3c\/strong\x3e but Trustees have a wide-ranging remit and there are opportunities for involved across the work that SHRUB undertakes.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22why-become-a-trustee\x22\x3eWhy become a Trustee?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSHRUB is a cooperative with premises in central Edinburgh. Our Members contribute to decision-making processes. Trustees have special legal responsibilities and, in some circumstances may have to make sensitive or critical decisions on behalf of the Coop.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eA Steering Group was established in May 2020 and now helps staff and working groups take the day-to-day decisions - meaning the Trustees’ role is genuinely oversight and strategy.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees learn about how our Social Enterprise runs and gain skills in leadership, problem - solving and innovation, strategic judgement and effective communication, to name a few.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eServing as a Trustee is an opportunity to learn about the governance of a not-for-profit organisation in a supportive environment, learning from more experienced Trustees and staff and the fresh perspective of newer Members alike.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22key-responsibilities\x22\x3eKey Responsibilities\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees’ key responsibilities fall into the following areas:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eVision mission and aims\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eStrategy and objectives\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eCulture and values\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eAccountable leadership\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eControl environment\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eGovernance processes\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eSuccession planning\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22what-skills-do-i-need\x22\x3eWhat skills do I need?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees have a wide-ranging remit with some people leading on particular aspects, some playing a more general role. We particularly encourage applications from under-represented groups, including but not limited to: people of colour, trans people, non-binary people and women.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees are responsible for overseeing development of the strategic framework within which day- to-day tasks are carried out by staffers and volunteers, and they help guide our long-term planning.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWhat is the time commitment?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs a voluntary Trustee, you will make some clear time commitments: to attend regular Trustee meetings (2 hours each month, currently on a Monday evening), and participate in staff support mechanisms.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees will preferably participate in the work of a Working Group - attending meetings where possible and contributing to the direction and content of work.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs a cooperative, SHRUB Coop makes transparent, and effective decisions mostly by a Steering Group. Trustees delegate the day-to-day decisions to the Steering Group, comprising Trustees, Members (both Volunteer and Supporter Members) and Staff. The Steering Group meets at least every fortnight (currently online only).\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTime off can be arranged among Trustees, ensuring that there is a balance between Trustees’ wellbeing and SHRUB Coop functioning. If you cannot make a meeting you let people know. There is a Welfare Working Group to support mental, physical and emotional wellbeing of volunteers and members if you need support in regulating your engagement.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eWho can apply?\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAnyone who supports the Vision and Mission of SHRUB Coop is invited to apply.

  var str = "\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eA quick introduction about myself. Born and bred in Brisbane, Australia I unknowingly moved to Edinburgh weeks before the pandemic hit. With a Bachelor of Design and a Graduate Certificate in Science (Environment and Sustainability) my aim was to continue into a job that tickled my passion for sustainability, community and creativity. Covid-19 thought I was overreaching with simply wanting a job but luckily I came by part time work and I found Shrub, an outlet for my passions, a community to be a part of, and a space to (hopefully) make a difference. As part of the Comms Working Group I hope to contribute my penchant for writing and scientific research, my love of illustration and photography and an unwavering belief that a little humour can tackle anything.\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eHow many times have you gotten home from the shops only to remember that you forgot to buy something? If not the main ingredient for dinner that night, it’s usually something you ran out of days, if not weeks ago. What if I told you there were ingredients in your cupboard that could fill the void of many plastic-packaged products and more. What if I told you there was this mystical world of cheap and easy craftiness that was better for the environment, your health and your wallet. That world is called DIY (Do-It-Yourself) or \x3cem\x3emake it yourself\x3c\/em\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1600791558\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/image_1_ze05lw.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3cem\x3eDIY Citrus cleaner\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22why-do-it-yourself-when-you-can-just-buy-it\x22\x3eWhy do-it-yourself when you can just buy it?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThere are many great advantages to DIY.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eThe price:\x3c\/strong\x3e It’s cheaper. For example, on the cheap end, a new cleaning spray costs around £1 per bottle. A 1L bottle of vinegar can be less than 60p and be used to make numerous bottles of cleaning spray.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eThe simplicity:\x3c\/strong\x3e You don’t need to be a wizard - it’s easy! Recipes can be as easy or complicated as you like. If you can measure and mix, you can already make 100s of DIY products.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eThe environment:\x3c\/strong\x3e Reuse! Save on new, unnecessary plastic by refilling containers you already have. DIY helps save the planet through recycling and upcycling materials, bottles and ingredients already in your home. Most cleaning products come in plastic all destined to become waste. Instead, refill and reuse and eventually, one far day away, you can then recycle.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eIt’s rewarding:\x3c\/strong\x3e It’s fun, you’re learning new skills and it’s rewarding knowing not only that you made it yourself, but that you saved another plastic bottle from the bin.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eLess toxins\x3c\/strong\x3e: The ingredients list found on many products in our homes might as well be in Latin. With toxic ingredients, palm oil and other nasties commonly found in everything from cleaners to face creams, making products yourself gives you more control to live a less toxic and less environmentally harmful life.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eGifting\x3c\/strong\x3e: Handmade gifts, whether perfect or comically misshapen, are far more personal and heartfelt.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22the-example-vinegar\x22\x3eThe example: Vinegar!\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eA staple of most kitchens, dirt cheap, readily accessible and purchasable in large quantities, vinegar is a magical ingredient found in numerous DIY recipes. Let me give you the example below, \x3cstrong\x3eall purpose cleaner\x3c\/strong\x3e, as it could not be easier and is a great introduction to the world of DIY. I should mention that you do not need to be precious about measuring and you can most definitely reuse an empty spray bottle, thus saving it from an eternity in landfill. Distilled white vinegar is most commonly used for its cheapness but apple cider vinegar works great too, has the same benefits and a better smell.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1600792232\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/image_2_mkljgf.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe simplicity and wonderment of DIY is knowing how to use the ingredients and just how multipurpose they all are, which all comes from \x3cem\x3eGoogling\x3c\/em\x3e and practise. With vinegar and a couple more simple ingredients, you can make numerous products; toilet bombs, bug repellent, dishwasher tablets, face masks, hair conditioning spray, laundry soaker and a cleaner for the kitchen, bathroom, windows, tables …the list goes on. Why is vinegar so magical? It’s cheap and has a long shelf life. It’s natural and biodegradable so it can be used indoors and outdoors. It creates an inhospitable environment for many microorganisms due to its pH of 2.0 and the acetic acid content making it great to use at home.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1600792254\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/image_3_bfw8rg.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22baby-steps\x22\x3eBaby steps!\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eMy big tip for starting your DIY journey. BABY STEPS. There are a million and one recipes online which can be both daunting and confusing. Keep it simple. You will get to know how to use, mix and most importantly, how multipurpose each ingredient can be. As each product slowly runs out in your home, have a look at a DIY alternative that includes ingredients you already have or can easily and sustainably source. You will start to see similar ingredients overlapping and realise that you only need a few ingredients to make many different products.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eMy journey started in the kitchen, namely the dark and dreaded shelf under my sink that contained a cleaning product for every different surface or space in my apartment. A DIY citrus cleaner was project number one, chosen as a way to use up the lemon peels I quickly accumulated. Over months, that shelf went from full to near empty with vinegar, castile soap and bicarb proudly taking their place. As I learnt, most of my DIY cleaning recipes shared those same ingredients in varying quantities.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTo finish is one of my favourite DIY recipes, the aforementioned \x3cstrong\x3ecitrus cleaner\x3c\/strong\x3e. Not only does it smell great and work well, but it’s beautiful sitting on my kitchen bench and gives my food waste another life. The next time you run out of something at home, have a quick pause and consider DIY-ing it. Trust me, you’re baby steps away from making your life easier and greener.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1600792300\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/image_4_l0r9i4.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

  var str = "\x3cp\x3eWith Oatly’s recent announcement of a 10% buyout by the Blackstone Group we thought it was time to have a bit of a deeper dive into some of our suppliers. This has led to several rabbit holes with some unpleasant surprises down them. It’s almost like there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism, funny that.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs a cafe we need an oat milk that tastes good, foams well and is easily available. So here’s a quick round up of some of the alternatives that are out there.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1600793467\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/oat_milk_bcbsy5.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAlpro does a barista style oat milk, but Alpro is 100% owned by Danone; one of the world’s largest investors and producers of dairy products with a less than stellar record on human rights in the supply-chain.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eRude Health is another one that has cropped up recently, but is unfortunately part-owned by Pepsico…nope…\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eHow about Califa Farms? Well the oat milk is delicious but the investment by the Qatari Wealth Fund leaves a bitter after-taste.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eProvamel? Unfortunately it’s owned by Alpro.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eMinor Figures doesn’t seem to have any skeletons in their closet but they have recently received a £7.5 million investment from an undisclosed source to expand their operations in the USA. It would be nice to know who that is from.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe final one that we want to mention is a very new and very local company called Untitled Oats. They will be producing oat milk commercially within the next couple of months and delivering it in fully reusable containers. We’re very excited to see how things go with them and would love to have them as a supplier. We’re keeping our fingers crossed.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs it stands we are not entirely sure who we should be using as our oat milk supplier for the interim. Navigating the ethical implications of different suppliers is difficult at best. With a lack of transparency, shell companies and dodgy investments as the norm, we’re hoping to put our faith in small-scale local production as we move forward.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eAlun - Cafe Coordinator\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eDisclaimer: I’m not an investigative reporter, there’s been a lot of googling and looking at company registrations online to try and figure this out. If anyone spots any errors then please please please let us know!\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.corporatebenchmark.org\/sites\/default\/files\/2018-11\/Danone%20CHRB%202018%20Results%20on%2020181026%20at%20171611.pdf\x22\x3eLink to Danone’s ethical report\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n"
