While we should all now be aware of the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/newsround\/58156019\x22\x3efashion industry’s contribution to climate change\x3c\/a\x3e, we do still need to wear (and therefore sometimes buy) clothes.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eBut knowing about the causes of climate change and being aware of our consumer power comes with great responsibility – when you need new pants\/socks\/trousers\/shoes, how do you make the most ethical choice?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAs consumers we have more choice than ever, and thanks to a growing awareness and responsibility among those in the fashion industry, there is an excellent range of sustainable options for almost any item you need.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eBut what is the most important thing to look for? Is it better to choose organic cotton, which has less of an environmental impact on the soil in which it’s grown or something that was made in an ethical factory that provides education and healthcare, as well as a fair living wage to all its employees? How about something printed and assembled in the UK, reducing the miles it travels between the factories where it gets its treatments? When combined with the other considerations of price, availability and personal preference, the choices can become overwhelming. Caring so much can soon seem like a curse, how do you make a choice?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3ePart of the reason that these choices are more complex now compared to twenty years ago is that very few fashion brands then were engaged with sustainability. The majority probably didn’t care about workers’ rights or the provenance of their materials and so, irrespective of your own concerns, you didn’t have a sustainable option and a therefore simpler choice. That such a growing number of brands have added ethical or sustainable ranges (if not their whole offering) is in part down to consumer pressure. It’s important that we continue to promote the brands that are making real progress in their efforts to produce clothing in a way that has a minimal environmental impact. Of course, it has to be recognised that there are still many fashion brands who don’t acknowledge the huge role their industry plays in climate change – your consumer voice (and your wallet) are the best tools you have to drive change. Shop with sustainable brands where you can, and where you can’t, use social media to tell other brands how they can improve. Fashion Revolution have \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fashionrevolution.org\/resources\/how-tos\/\x22\x3elots of information\x3c\/a\x3e on how to maximise the impact of your actions.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIn answer to the question at the top of the page, the very fact that you’re spending time considering your purchasing options means that you’re likely to make a more sustainable choice. Whether you’re looking at a brand’s credentials, reading a clothing label or considering how you’ll use and care for the garment, you’re engaging with the reality of the fashion industry and the power your money can hold in encouraging brands to keep getting it right. You should feel good about whatever choice you then make.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eSome tips for a sustainable purchase\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3col\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eDo you need it? Do you already have something at home that would serve the same purpose? Remember – the most sustainable piece of clothing is one you already own.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eWhat’s your budget? There is nothing to be gained by spending amounts that are unaffordable to you, no matter how sustainable the item. A less pricey, and more sustainable alternative to buying new is to buy second hand. Charity shops, eBay, Depop and similar sites all have an amazing array of barely (and in some cases never) worn clothes.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eFind a reliable source of information on who in the fashion industry takes sustainability seriously. The \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.fashionrevolution.org\/about\/transparency\/\x22\x3eFashion Transparency Index\x3c\/a\x3e might be a good place to start and you can find brands that align best with your values.\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eDo your research on fabrics and find the ones that you’ll be able to care for in a way that easy for you. The better you care for clothing, the less frequently you’ll need to shop for more! \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/resource-packs\/fabric-awareness-information-booklet\/\x22\x3eSHRUB has a booklet that can help with this.\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eYou may need to accept that the “perfect” item (e.g. something that ticks all the sustainability boxes) might not be available to you, in which case just make the best choice you can find. After all, if you need some pants, buy some pants!\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ol\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3eBy now it’s recognised that remaining informed about and engaging with the climate crisis can cause anxiety for some people and as such, please be kind to yourself and try not to feel like you alone have to shoulder the weight of the world’s problems. If you are finding the topics discussed overwhelming, please talk to someone about it. SAMH can offer information and advice on dealing with anxiety.\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

From takeaway coffees to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.globalcitizen.org\/en\/content\/why-you-shouldnt-use-microbead-soap\/?template=next\x22\x3esoaps containing microplastics\x3c\/a\x3e, plastic is practically part of our cultural landscape - and it’s one of the biggest destroyers of our natural landscape. Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced even the most committed climate activists\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2020\/05\/plastic-pollution-waste-pandemic-covid19-coronavirus-recycling-sustainability\/\x22\x3e to adopt plastic for the protection of themselves and others\x3c\/a\x3e, but the danger is that this necessity gives way to complacency and all the progress made towards more environmentally-friendly materials is abandoned.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3ePlastic Free July is an important movement that aims to highlight the unnecessary societal reliance on plastics. It is an opportunity for new zero waste and climate activists to shift towards more sustainable practices with the support of a global community, and for those already living plastic-free to recommit and share their experiences with others. However, the purpose of Plastic Free July extends beyond just individual behavioural change. As we have discussed in Shrub Coop many times, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sustainable-business\/2017\/jul\/10\/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change\x22\x3ethe greatest responsibility for environmental action lies with the biggest corporations\x3c\/a\x3e, yet too often it is the individual consumer who is made to carry this climate burden. Plastic Free July challenges this narrative and instead aims to push for an entire system change by proving that consumers do not need such excessive plastic use.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThere are a wealth of resources available online and on social media to help people to quit plastic, and the reach of this campaign grows every year. Of course, committing to being plastic free for a month is an impressive feat in and of itself, but for those who manage to maintain some of these new patterns throughout the rest of the year, it is truly phenomenal. And not only that, but it is proof that everyone can cut down on their plastic waste, July or not. That’s part of what drives our mission at Shrub Coop - we envision a world without waste and we know that it is possible. So to help those of you who are just finishing up your Plastic Free July challenge, or for anyone interested in testing the waters of a plastic-less life, we recently posted some of our \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CRqc5WMq1fu\/\x22\x3etop tips to remove plastic from your life.\x3c\/a\x3e There are lots of small changes we can make that will have a big collective impact, so instead of waiting until next July to start, why not start removing plastic from your life today? You might be surprised at how creative you can be!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1627387864\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/14_swtzcz.png\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1627387884\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/15_jp5yuo.png\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

  var str = "\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1627033110\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/wish_jsvo52.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3ePhoto source \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.innovatorsmag.com\/wishcycling-wont-save-planet\/\x22\x3ehere\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3chr \/\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSo you’re standing at your bins with an empty pizza box in hand wondering where to put it. The box is made of cardboard, and cardboard is recyclable, so surely that means the box should go in the recycling bin? Okay, there’s a bit of grease on the bottom of the box, but what harm can that do? Worse comes to worst, someone will remove the box from the cardboard recycling pile, but at least you did your part. Better than sending it straight to landfill, right? Wrong.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe above example depicts the process and logic behind wishcycling, the act of rather blindly hoping that something is recyclable because it feels better than throwing it in the bin. As is apparent, the rationale behind this process is not intentionally damaging, but rather a testament to the optimism of those who care about the planet and want to do what they can to reduce their non-recyclable waste. However, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.greenmatters.com\/p\/wishcycling\x22\x3ethe damaging impact of wishcycling \x3c\/a\x3eis so much greater than we often anticipate that it can throw into question the true intention of wishcyclers altogether.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhen an item that does not belong in the recycling bin gets placed there, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.vogeldisposal.com\/vogel-disposal-news\/what-happens-when-the-wrong-things-go-into-recycling-4022\x22\x3eit can disrupt and halt the entire recycling process\x3c\/a\x3e. Given that it is mostly machines that carry out the sorting at recycling plants, the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/theecofairy.com\/blogs\/news\/we-all-need-to-stop-wishcycling\x22\x3eintroduction of non-recyclable items can jam these systems which results in huge losses of time and money while these machines are repaired\x3c\/a\x3e. This has the knock-on effect of decreasing the recycling output, thus defeating the purpose of the wishcycler’s intention. In an even more devastating series of events, the non-recyclable materials can get through the machines’ sorting processes and end up \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.wlrn.org\/news\/2018-12-19\/a-tale-of-too-much-wishcycling-a-look-at-miami-dades-low-recycle-rate\x22\x3econtaminating the entire batch\x3c\/a\x3e of recyclable material that is to be sold for repurposing. When this occurs, that batch ends up in landfill as there are not the resources to remove the non-recyclable elements, and so the environment suffers an even greater loss than if the greasy pizza box had just been placed in the general waste bin in the first place.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eRecycling has been a relatively controversial process since its adoption into civil society. Many eco-behavioural analysts have argued that recycling impedes environmental progress because people view it as a one-stop action to prove their environmental commitment, without addressing some of the more major factors damaging the planet such as overconsumption or lifestyle factors. Of course, this viewpoint must be balanced with the knowledge that it is the world’s top corporations that are responsible for the majority of the environmental destruction that has led to the climate crisis. However, it is part of their marketing to portray recycling as a primary solution, shifting the environmental burden to consumers, and it is this societal pressure to recycle that has led people to believe that almost anything is recyclable. In order to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/dirtylabs.com\/blogs\/the-dirt\/what-is-wishcycling\x22\x3etackle wishcycling\x3c\/a\x3e, and ensure that our waste truly is minimised, it is necessary to educate ourselves about what can and cannot be recycled in our local areas. This can vary from place to place, and it is often updated as technology progresses, therefore it is worth checking the guidelines regularly to maximise our environmental impact. When in doubt as to whether or not something can be recycled, Google it! There is a wealth of information available online that can help us to ensure our environmental intentions ring true. Finally, for more difficult to recycle items, look at alternative recycling schemes such as \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.terracycle.com\/en-GB\x22\x3eTerraCycle\x3c\/a\x3e, which specialise in the collection and recycling of items such as Pringles cans, beauty items and McVities wrappers. Recycling efficiently requires commitment, but if we’re recycling to help save the planet, we might as well do it wholeheartedly.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

In the UK alone, 1 in 5 people have a disability of some form \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/bighack.org\/accessibility-and-disability-facts-and-figures\/\x22\x3e1 in 5 people have a disability of some form\x3c\/a\x3e (according to data from 2019), and yet there is limited representation in fashion for this large portion of our population. Disabilities can take a range of forms, defined as a ‘physical, mental, cognitive, or development condition that impairs, interferes with or limits a person’s ability to engage in certain actions…’ (\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/disability\x22\x3eMerriam-Webster 2021\x3c\/a\x3e). For many people with disabilities, they are faced with challenges arising from the nature of our society being structured towards able-bodied people, and the fashion industry is just one of the many that has failed to dismantle some of the barriers to inclusion. From having wheelchair-inaccessible entrances that physically impede access to shopping, to designing clothes that match only the needs of able-bodied people, fashion remains far from accessible for a large proportion of the population.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAdaptive clothing (clothing designed for wheelchair users, those with \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.sensorysmart.co.uk\x22\x3esensory sensitivities \x3c\/a\x3eand other forms of disabilities) has grown as an industry over the last few years. Just as with plus-sized body types, adaptive clothing lines have a tendency to focus on functionality over creativity, meaning that once again it is the able-bodied, straight-sized people who are privileged enough to engage with fashion trends and style experimentation. Though this is slowly changing, adaptive clothing brands remain in the shadows of the fashion industry instead of being ushered into the spotlight. This then has the knock-on effect of diminishing the opportunities for disabled people to engage in fashion marketing campaigns and runways, thus leading to a lack of representation for disabled people in fashion advertising.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSyanne Centeno-Bloom, is a wheelchair-using model working to end ableism in the fashion industry and normalise disabled bodies across all sectors. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.intimately.co\/post\/ableism-in-the-fashion-industry\x22\x3eShe has talked openly of the discrimination she has faced \x3c\/a\x3etrying to book modelling jobs and discusses some of the discriminatory excuses she has heard over the years working in the industry. However, Syanne has made a name for herself as a successful model and advocate, providing some much-needed representation in fashion advertising for those who have disabilities. Her career has proven that fashion is not an able-bodied person’s game, but it has the capacity to open and include people of all shapes, sizes, colours and abilities.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFashion marketing has begun to acknowledge the ways in which it has failed those who do not fit the able-bodied prototype that has dominated the world of design for so long. More and more disabled models are debuting the haute couture of leading designers such as Carrie Hammer on the runway. More and more designers recognise the positive effects of inclusive fashion lines, with \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sustainable-business\/sustainable-fashion-blog\/fashion-industry-letting-down-disabled-disability-cost-beauty\x22\x3estudies proving that inclusivity and diversity makes people more likely to shop.\x3c\/a\x3e Fashion permeates so many of our daily interactions as we consume it through advertisements on our phones, walking up busy high streets and in choosing our own clothing. It is therefore necessary to engage with more inclusive fashion campaigns that understand the damage caused by exclusion. There is more than one way to strut down a catwalk, and it’s about time we acknowledge it.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

Was it assumed that women would pedal away from their husbands, abandoning family and home? Or were men threatened by the idea of women participating in a sport\/leisure activity, and that this might lead to a revolution against the Victorian-era belief that women’s only role was in the domestic sphere? Whatever the logic was, the invention of safer, more practical bicycles brought women’s issues to the fore. The restrictive clothing they were forced to wear made it difficult for them to participate - initially. By the late 1800s, there was pressure to reform women’s fashion and finally, corsets began to disappear from women’s attire. Not only that, but the\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/amazingwomeninhistory.com\/the-new-woman-and-her-bicycle\/\x22\x3eintroduction of bloomers made cycling more feasible for women.\x3c\/a\x3e The combination of bloomers and bicycle became a symbol of revolution and independence, and as the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.welovecycling.com\/wide\/2018\/03\/26\/role-bicycle-suffragette-movement\/\x22\x3esuffragette movement grew in the 20th century, the bicycle remained an icon of freedom\x3c\/a\x3e.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe battle to get on the saddle was a huge leap forward for women, but the power of the bicycle has dwindled over the years. According to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.sustrans.org.uk\/media\/2930\/2930.pdf\x22\x3ea recent study by Sustrans\x3c\/a\x3e, only nine percent of women cycle on a weekly basis, compared with twenty-one percent of men. Furthermore, men tend to travel further by bicycle than women, so there is a clear divide in the use of bicycles between men and women. In attempting to identify the barriers to cycling, Sustrans reports that seventy-one percent of women believe that the roads are too dangerous to navigate, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/national-bike-month\/\x22\x3ea topic we have covered in Shrub Coop previously\x3c\/a\x3e. There are also concerns around harassment, the tight-fitting clothing associated with cycling, stresses about being ‘fit enough’ to cycle, and of course there are financial and educational barriers to participating fully.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhile one of the advantages of using a bike instead of public transport is that you are not reliant on a transport service that operates only during specific hours, the idea of cycling at night or in poorly-lit areas can be a huge deterrent for women in using their bikes. The fear of attracting negative attention follows women from footpaths to cycling lanes, therefore it is necessary to ensure that cycling infrastructure incorporates these safety concerns. While green spaces are definitely necessary in cities such as Edinburgh, efforts to direct cycling routes along wide, bright roads could go a long way in improving opportunities for women to cycle.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe image of lycra-clad cyclists has transformed cycling from a leisure activity to one requiring the ultimate fitness. Naturally, this can deter women who have long suffered scrutiny for their fashion choices; for many, the idea of slipping into form-fitting cycling gear can be daunting to say the least. However, there are plenty of ways to adjust your fashion choices to the cycling lifestyle, from tying knots in skirts and dresses to \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.sustrans.org.uk\/our-blog\/get-active\/2019\/everyday-walking-and-cycling\/bikes-for-women\/\x22\x3echoosing a bicycle more suitable to your needs\x3c\/a\x3e. In many of the cities where cycling is most popular, clothing is designed with cycling in mind: look at the loose-fitting clothing of the Danes for example. With nine out of ten people who own a bike cycling it every day, getting into lycra is not feasible for most bike-users, and so \x3ca href=\x22http:\/\/www.copenhagencyclechic.com\x22\x3ecycling in more practical clothing has contributed to the fashion landscape of the nation\x3c\/a\x3e! Clothing can also be a difficult barrier to overcome for particular cultures, but thankfully there are a number of organisations emerging who seek to teach women how they can adjust their attire to benefit from cycling.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOn a similar vein, there is a perception that you must be very fit to use a bike. Of course, cycling is a fantastic way to engage in exercise, but the mentality that it is a sport rather than a means of transport or recreational activity can be damaging to many beginner or potential cyclists. It is true that Edinburgh is a rather hilly city, but there are plenty of routes that are mostly flat that can help people to gain confidence in their cycling ability. With a bit of practice, even the more challenging hills may not seem so steep!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFinally, it cannot be ignored that cycling is not always accessible to all groups in society. Purchasing a bicycle can be a costly and confusing experience, particularly for those of us who do not know much about bikes! \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/employmentandlabourmarket\/peopleinwork\/earningsandworkinghours\/bulletins\/genderpaygapintheuk\/2019\x22\x3eWith women continuing to receive less income than men\x3c\/a\x3e, it is hardly surprising that the rate of bicycle ownership is lower amongst women. Furthermore, maintaining a bicycle requires a degree of expertise (how do you change a tube?), so it is easy to give up when your bicycle starts making funky sounds - especially for those with lower incomes who cannot afford to get their bike professionally repaired. At Wee Spoke Hub, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/getting-onto-the-saddle\/\x22\x3ewe aim to remove these barriers \x3c\/a\x3eby offering advice on purchasing and repairing bikes at a low cost.

As well as this, we are introducing womxn and non-binary DIY bike repair sessions, to offer skills to bike-users who may feel uncomfortable with the very masculine environment often present in bike shops. Unlike a lot of bike stores, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CKetqIeDQIx\/\x22\x3eour Wee Spoke Hub Mechanic\x3c\/a\x3e identifies as a woman and is keen to get more womxn and non-binary folk feeling safe and empowered on their bikes.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eUnfortunately, gender inequality prevails in almost every domain of our society, but at Shrub Coop, we want to empower as many people as possible to take up cycling. The bicycle was once an emblem of women’s emancipation, and over time, we hope to see its power restored. The fight for equality is far from over!\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

Pride Month commemorates the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.history.com\/news\/stonewall-riots-timeline\x22\x3eStonewall uprising in 1969\x3c\/a\x3e when a number of LGBTQ\x2b activists protested the police raids on a gay bar in New York. This uprising proved the necessary catalyst for societies to recognise the injustices enacted against this community, and in the years since then, countries such as the UK have made significant progress in promoting equal and more inclusive societies. Of course, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.gaytimes.co.uk\/life\/lgbtq-rights-may-have-progressed-but-young-people-are-still-struggling\/\x22\x3ethere is still a long way to go in many aspects\x3c\/a\x3e, but Pride Month focuses on celebrating the diverse identities of the LGBTQ\x2b community. Having the freedom to express their authentic selves, it is only in celebrating diversity that we can create a truly inclusive society.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eUnfortunately, amidst the celebration of authenticity and liberation, these central messages of Pride have been co-opted by some questionable interests. ‘\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/lgbtq-pride-consumerism\/\x22\x3eRainbow-washing\x3c\/a\x3e’ is a term used to describe the display of rainbow merchandise and motifs in marketing, a common tactic used throughout June. Similar to greenwashing, rainbow-washing can often be misleading as corporations seek to endear themselves to consumers by aligning themselves with important social justice issues such as LGBTQ\x2b equality. However, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.mic.com\/p\/rainbow-washing-is-all-the-rage-among-the-big-corporations-this-month-81192984\x22\x3ethe exploitation of social movements can be detrimental to the causes themselves\x3c\/a\x3e, trivialising the issues and damaging the authenticity of the cause. With that said, it is hard to recognise the line between ally-ship and marketing. For some people, it can be encouraging to see more and more businesses displaying their support for the LGBTQ\x2b community, and can even help people to recognise safe spaces for social gatherings. Furthermore, the displays of rainbow flags can provide \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/emindful.com\/2021\/06\/07\/finding-and-loving-your-authentic-self-during-pride-month\/\x22\x3ea meaningful visual testimony\x3c\/a\x3e to the progress that has been made in creating an inclusive society in the UK. So how do we discern what true ally-ship looks like amidst this bombardment of rainbows from every shop corner?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWhere possible, conducting some research about the businesses and corporations we are engaging with can be the best way to ascertain whether a brand really promotes equality in their daily operations, not just in June. While Pride Month may be a discrete period of time in the calendar, its central themes of authenticity, liberation and inclusivity should reverberate year-round. At Shrub Coop, we pride ourselves (pun intended) on our ethos of inclusivity and equality that drives the work we do every day. We have committed ourselves to promoting LGBTQ\x2b rights, and this can be seen in our shop and through our social media. With gender-neutral clothing displays, changing rooms and bathrooms, we aim to provide a safe space for everyone to be their authentic selves. Shrub Coop is a queer space where members of the LGBTQ\x2b community can feel safe and respected. We have a \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/shrub-safer-spaces-policy\/\x22\x3eSafer Spaces Policy\x3c\/a\x3e in place to help keep any marginalised groups or individuals feeling safe and welcomed in our community. We are a member-led organisation, made up in large part by the LGBTQ\x2b community and we have been able to grow and thrive as a result of the valuable contribution so many LGBTQ\x2b members have made to our community.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe also wish to ensure that members of the LGBTQ\x2b community are given the recognition they deserve as leaders in the charge for change, such as their\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/how-the-lgbtq-community-is-shaping-climate-activism\/\x22\x3e involvement in the climate justice movement\x3c\/a\x3e. We practise inclusion and are always looking for ways to improve and reinforce this commitment. As a result, we hope that when you see our Pride Flag flying year-round, you can know that this is a space in which the LGBTQ\x2b community can feel at home.\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

  var str = "\x3cp\x3eHave you ever had a meltdown over buying pants? Spent two weeks solidly trying to research which are the most environmentally friendly, ethically sound pair of pants to buy? Realised that the perfect option doesn’t exist and wondered how hard it would be to make your own from an old t-shirt? I have (I even have a sewing pattern and all of the pieces cut out), and from the conversations I have had with other people, it sounds like I am not the only one.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1623234294\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/pants_post_kb0zaf.png\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSustainable Fashion is another area in which we, as the consumers, can often end up feeling all of the guilt and responsibility for making the right choice. While it is true that we can make changes and conscious decisions about what we do and don’t want to buy, we can also only choose from the options that are available to us. It should not be our responsibility to magically create the perfect pair of comfortable, well fitting recycled cotton pants from thin air for ourselves to buy for an actually affordable price. That responsibility should be for the companies who are making clothes.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSpending anything more than 2 days trying to find the perfect pair of pants probably means that you are already very environmentally conscious and are making enough changes in other areas of your life to let yourself off with the occasional less than perfect pants purchase. If everyone on the planet was only buying a few new pairs of pants each year, we would be in a completely different, much more manageable situation in terms of textile waste and recycling. Instead of beating yourself up over the things you haven’t quite found the perfect solution for yet, why not think about all of the things you are doing right? Many of the people who come into our shop now buy almost exclusively second hand,that is an amazing thing to be doing and we should be celebrating that rather than always feeling bad for not having made it that final 2% to the perfect zero waste lifestyle.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eP.S If there is anyone out there who does in fact know of the perfect pair of pants, please get in touch, I know many people who are all waiting for this information!\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

  var str = "\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1621869424\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/IMG_7586_2_c0syna.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3eAt Shrub Coop, we regularly promote our Swap Shop and Depop as a great place to find more eco-friendly clothing gems that you can wear and cherish for years to come. We strongly believe that sustainable fashion should be promoted and adopted by as many people as possible, but like many other industries, sustainable fashion can sometimes be exclusionary and daunting for many people. One of the biggest gaps in the sustainable fashion industry is the lack of plus-sized clothing available in charity shops or at online second-hand retailers. This can deter individuals from embarking on their sustainable fashion journey, despite having the best of intentions to quit fast fashion. Sustainable fashion is often much more accessible for ‘straight-sized’ people,and it is important to bear this in mind when engaging in conversations around secondhand shopping and thrifting with others. Sustainable fashion journeys can often look very different for people of different body types and while working to remove the barriers to more ethical clothing, we must remain cautious to ensure that the\x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2015\/dec\/06\/body-image-healthy-fashion-models-young-people-rosie-nelson\x22\x3einsecurities rampant in the fast fashion industry are not absorbed by the sustainable fashion industry.\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe fashion industry as a whole has long faced criticism for its inconsistent sizing and promotion of certain body types. For ‘straight-sized’ people, there are a vast array of styles available from every retailer. These clothing lines generally focus on the latest trends, being updated on a regular basis. For plus-sized people, however, it is a different story. To begin with, many brands do not offer plus-sized lines, and those that do are often accused of repeating the same designs and failing to keep up with the rest of the fashion industry. There is therefore a \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2016\/sep\/26\/average-woman-plus-sized-fashion-doesnt-reflect-that\x22\x3enoticeable gap between the offerings for straight-sized people and those who are plus-sized.\x3c\/a\x3e This is exacerbated even more for those who are keen to shop more sustainably, as there is often an even smaller selection of clothing available to them in charity shops and online.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe fashion industry already stands to benefit from the insecurities of individuals by making us feel as though our favourite style of jeans is outdated, or that the colours we tend to wear are no longer flattering… In fact, each new fashion line exploits our insecurities in some small way in order to encourage us to buy the latest collection. It is not easy to live in a world where we are constantly comparing ourselves to the models in the advertisements, yet this is exactly what pushes us to keep purchasing what they are wearing. \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2014\/oct\/14\/women-body-image-anxiety-improve-body-confidence\x22\x3eNo wonder body positivity is so hard to come by.\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAt Shrub Coop, we are trying to tackle some of these crises in the fashion industry. In the spirit of fostering an inclusive community united against climate issues and waste, we have added a large section of plus-sized clothing to our Swap Shop. We also want to remove the negativity of fashion campaigns from the shopping experience at Shrub, which is why we have created a ‘self-love’ mirror in the changing rooms. The idea behind this is that everyone, no matter how you look or how confident you feel, can identify at least one thing they love about themselves before, during, or after trying on items in the Swap Shop. This self-love mirror encourages us to recognise that our self-worth is not found in our clothing, but in ourselves! Sustainable fashion is not an industry for the few, but for everyone, and we want to welcome people of all shapes and sizes to reduce their impact on the planet and to love themselves while doing so!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1621869468\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/IMG_7783_2_giidgp.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n"
