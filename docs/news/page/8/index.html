Wardrobe revamps have become part of the regenerative symbol of spring, leaving a trail of poisonous dyes and discarded fabrics behind them.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThe clothing industry has a huge carbon footprint – it takes around 8000 litres of water to produce just one pair of blue jeans. Yet, the environmental impact doesn’t seem to deter us from shopping: more than 1 million tons of clothing are bought each year while \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/fashion\/2019\/feb\/19\/dont-feed-monster-the-people-who-have-stopped-buying-new-clothes?CMP=twt_a-environment_b-gdneco\x26fbclid=IwAR13bcfQ2_15EuO_9VDbNOuM2Q3KrMzwl2GlU5yQFkK8lWK5XnGvNRxf2ig\x22\x3e430,000 tonnes end up in landfill\x3c\/a\x3e annually in the UK alone.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAt SHRUB we’re making an effort to reduce these numbers within the Edinburgh community. We run workshops on fixing, making, and altering clothes, as well as operating a Swapshop in our Hub at 22 Bread Street (you can either buy clothes or bring your own to swap for others).\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSwapping used clothes is a great way to update your wardrobe while keeping your shopping ethical. Edinburgh has plenty of groups for swapping clothes in the \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/TheMeadowsShare\/\x22\x3eMeadows\x3c\/a\x3e, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/150953238396384\/\x22\x3eBroughton and Leith\x3c\/a\x3e, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/572515392860750\/\x22\x3eCowgate and Grassmarket\x3c\/a\x3e, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1442756399277591\/\x22\x3ePortobello\x3c\/a\x3e, and \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/596622963814605\/\x22\x3eNorth\x3c\/a\x3e areas. You can also buy and sell clothes on \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.gumtree.com\/\x22\x3eGumtree\x3c\/a\x3e, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.preloved.co.uk\/\x22\x3ePreloved\x3c\/a\x3e, and \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.depop.com\/\x22\x3eDepop\x3c\/a\x3e, among other online platforms.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eHowever, if your clothes aren’t in a state to swap or sell, consider taking part in SHRUB’s informal workshops and learning to mend, upcycle, or repurpose materials from well-loved garments.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eEvery Thursday evening between 5 and 7pm, volunteers are at hand in 17 Guthrie Street to help members of the community mend clothes with sewing machines and by hand. These workshops are free and open to all, come along to find out more and to get help and advice on projects!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe also run workshops with first year students in Edinburgh to teach clothing repair and upcycling in halls. If you can’t make workshops but want to learn how to reduce your clothing footprint, \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.loveyourclothes.org.uk\/\x22\x3eLove Your Clothes\x3c\/a\x3e is a great resource for creative upcycling ideas, and tips on mending, stain removal and more.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOn a student shoestring budget? In May each year, volunteers from across SHRUB’s working groups collect clothes (as well as any other unwanted possessions) from first year halls and organise a ‘Free Fair’ in September for new students to pick up useful items. Keep an eye out on our blog and social media to learn more.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThis year, resist the pattern of celebrating spring by sending old clothes to landfill. If you need to clear space in your wardrobe, prioritise charity shops (the Swapshop is always grateful for donations) or share clothes with friends to promote a circular economy. Why worship the new when the old has got us covered?\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

In Edinburgh alone, more than 27 tonnes of edible food are thrown out every week – that’s equivalent to 54,000 meals.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSome of this wasted food is thrown out by households and individuals: you can find advice on reducing your own food waste footprint from \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.lovefoodhatewaste.com\/what-to-do\x22\x3eLove Food, Hate Waste\x3c\/a\x3e among others.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eMost of it, however, is thrown away by supermarkets who are cannot sell perfectly edible food after its ‘Best Before’ date. At the end of each day, good food that could fill empty plates is discarded unnecessarily. So what can we do about it?\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eThere are plenty of food-related ways to help reduce Edinburgh’s waste problem: firstly, by connecting surplus food with people and places that need it. Over the past five years, SHRUB’s Food Sharing group has collected tonnes of excess food from 25 local businesses and redistributed it to charities and members of the community. In 2018 alone, more than 30 tonnes were saved from a wasteful fate.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFood Sharing Edinburgh has also recently opened Scotland’s first Excess Food Supermarket, selling fresh, surplus food rescued from supermarkets with a budget-friendly ‘pay as you feel’ price tag. The Hub is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, from noon until 4pm in SHRUB’s base at 22 Bread Street, Edinburgh. Come in to meet us and hear more about our Zero Waste mission!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIf you are interested in volunteering with either of the above projects, help is always welcome so get in touch about collections or helping out at the Food Sharing Hub. Volunteers can also opt to run sustainable cooking workshops in student halls – with training provided from a chef – and get involved with organising sustainability events and workshops.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eFor more information on volunteering, check out our \x3ca href=\x22http:\/\/shrubcoop.org\/volunteer\x22\x3eavailable roles\x3c\/a\x3e or email us at \x3ca href=\x22mailto:foodsharing@shrubcoop.org\x22\x3efoodsharing@shrubcoop.org\x3c\/a\x3e.
