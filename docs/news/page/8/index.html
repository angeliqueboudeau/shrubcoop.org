Our team is small but our vision is vast! We‚Äôve been working to pick up on the work of welfare working groups past to build and grow into a once-again fully functional, self-sustaining working group. We‚Äôll now, hopefully, be able to work with all other groups and individuals at SHRUB to promote the health and wellbeing of all members, staff, and volunteers.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOur mission statement is:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cem\x3e‚ÄúTo ensure the mental, physical and emotional wellbeing of staff, volunteers and members of the coop. This will include creating accessible welfare policies, caring for wellbeing through workshops and drop in sessions and arbitrating conflicts and complaints.‚Äù\x3c\/em\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3ePractically, this means we‚Äôll be hosting meetings, drop-ins and various workshops throughout the year, open to anyone who feels up for attending. We‚Äôll also be managing the \x3ca href=\x22mailto:welfare@shrubcoop.org\x22\x3ewelfare@shrubcoop.org\x3c\/a\x3e email for anyone needing any kind of support, and we‚Äôll be taking feedback on the running of SHRUB more generally. We‚Äôre still looking for more volunteers to help with the running of this group. The tasks are diverse and can include collecting resources, hosting drop-ins, talking to other volunteers and external organisations, or fulfilling any of your own welfare-related ideas!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eIf you have a suggestion, grievance, or concern; are needing help or resources; or feel like contacting welfare for any other reason please feel free to email \x3ca href=\x22mailto:welfare@shrubcoop.org\x22\x3ewelfare@shrubcoop.org\x3c\/a\x3e or message any of the team individually.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSo far this team includes some familiar faces and a new volunteer, all equally enthused by the well-being of all folk at SHRUB:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eSiri:\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1578330678\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/welfare_pic_wlmvhc.jpg\x22 alt=\x22\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eI work full-time at SHRUB as the CCF Project Coordinator, which means I‚Äôm involved in a lot of the work behind the scenes, from funding to HR, monitoring and welfare work. I am passionate about making sure that all of us working to make the world a better place don‚Äôt burn ourselves out in the process, and about making sure there‚Äôs a space for everyone in the SHRUB community.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eContact: \x3ca href=\x22mailto:siri.pantzar@shrubcoop.org\x22\x3esiri.pantzar@shrubcoop.org\x3c\/a\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cstrong\x3eBillie:\x3c\/strong\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3e\x3cimg src=\x22https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/shrub-co-op\/image\/upload\/v1578391551\/shrubcoop.org\/media\/Billie_ctdq6k.jpg\x22 alt=\x22A photo of Billie\x22 title=\x22Billie\x22 \/\x3e\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eI work for SHRUB as the Circular Economy Programme Coordinator.

I believe in everything SHRUB does, and I believe that it‚Äôs now more important than ever. However, I know that when you‚Äôre passionate about a project, it‚Äôs very easy to forget your own welfare and become burnt out, and so by being part of the welfare working group, I hope to help everyone to look after themselves as well as the planet.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eContact: corran@shrubcoop.org\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eOnce again, we‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who is interested in joining!

That‚Äôs the date for your diaries. The official reopening of the Zero Waste Caf√© at 22 Bread Street.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eAfter an organic start for the caf√© a year ago, with a few cups of coffee made on the office kettle (the way all great things seem to start here at SHRUB Coop), we are finally ready to get things going to feed our growing zero-waste family.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eLead by our new Caf√© Coordinator, Alun, the community caf√© will be open from 12pm to 5pm between Tuesday and Saturday, with a fully \x3ca href=\x22https:\/\/www.shrubcoop.org\/working-groups\/zero-waste-hub\/\x22\x3evegetarian and vegan menu\x3c\/a\x3e. Enjoy our delicious \x3cstrong\x3eovernight oats\x3c\/strong\x3e, hearty \x3cstrong\x3evegan sandwiches\x3c\/strong\x3e and \x3cstrong\x3esoups\x3c\/strong\x3e, and plenty of \x3cstrong\x3ecakes\x3c\/strong\x3e of course, all while helping to fight climate breakdown. Oh, and we don‚Äôt charge extra for vegan milks (tell your friends)!\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe‚Äôve set ourselves an ambitious goal too, we‚Äôre aiming for our caf√© to be zero waste! That means \x3cstrong\x3eno disposable coffee cups\x3c\/strong\x3e and working to eliminate plastic packaging from our supply chain. We can‚Äôt promise we‚Äôll be 100% zero waste from the start, but we can promise that every choice and decision we make will be consciously made to eventually get us there. And that‚Äôs where these blog posts come in! Throughout our journey to becoming a zero waste caf√©, we‚Äôll be documenting the challenges and triumphs along the way to share with other businesses and home cooks. How do you make the perfect plastic-free panini from start to finish? We‚Äôre not sure yet, but we soon will, and we‚Äôll share the tips and tricks here.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eSo there you go, it‚Äôs written in a blog post now so it must be happening. We‚Äôd like you to join us on our journey towards zero waste and we‚Äôll be asking for your ideas each step of the way. It‚Äôs not going to be easy, and we won‚Äôt always get it right, but we want to have an honest conversation about waste.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eWe can‚Äôt wait to start this journey and feeding you all delicious food along the way. Here we go 2020!\x3c\/p\x3e\n"

Our Members contribute to decision- making processes. Trustees have special legal responsibilities and, in some circumstances may have to make sensitive or critical decisions on behalf of the Coop.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees learn about how our Social Enterprise runs and gain skills in leadership, problem-solving and innovation, strategic judgement and effective communication, to name a few.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eServing as a Trustee is an opportunity to learn about the governance of a not-for-profit organisation in a supportive environment, learning from more experienced Trustees and staff and the fresh perspective of newer Members alike.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22key-responsibilities\x22\x3eKey Responsibilities\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees‚Äô key responsibilities fall into the following areas:\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cul\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eVision mission and aims\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eStrategy and objectives\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eCulture and values\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eAccountable leadership\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eControl environment\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eGovernance processes\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3cli\x3eSuccession planning\x3c\/li\x3e\n\x3c\/ul\x3e\n\n\x3ch4 id=\x22what-skills-do-i-need\x22\x3eWhat skills do I need?\x3c\/h4\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTrustees have a wide-ranging remit with some people leading on particular aspects, some playing a more general role.

At least one Trustee attends these meetings (5-8pm Thursday once a month). There is opportunity outside of these times to contribute to new projects and discussions.\x3c\/p\x3e\n\n\x3cp\x3eTime off can be arranged among Trustees, ensuring that there is a balance between Trustees‚Äô wellbeing and SHRUB Coop functioning.
