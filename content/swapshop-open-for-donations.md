We are open for donations from our members again!

Thanks to all the efforts of our pricing volunteers, our donations bins are now empty and we are looking for you to bring us more.

We are particularly looking for: Good quality bric a brac, T-shirts, shirts, Plus size clothing/ larger sizes and male coded clothing.

We would like our Swapshop to be as accessible and inclusive as possible which is why we are asking for plus size clothing and male coded clothing as these are things that most second hand shops don't have much of.  The only things we sell in our Swapshop are the things you bring in so please keep bringing us your amazing donations to help our shop be as inclusive as possible. 

Please also check the list on our website of donations that we can't accept and where else you might be able to take them instead.
