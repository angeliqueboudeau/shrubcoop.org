We have been awarded a grant of £7,703.00 from the Scottish Government’s Community Climate Asset Fund for an electric cargo bike, fridge and freezer to help the Food Sharing Edinburgh Network to reduce local carbon emissions by reducing emissions for collections and deliveries and diverting more surplus food from landfill.

The CCAF is a Scottish Government fund, administered by Keep Scotland Beautiful, and 279 community-based organisations from across Scotland have been awarded more than £3.2 million of funding to tackle climate change.

CCAF Grantees should also display the CCAF logo strip on their website (where possible) on webpages that feature their CCAF funded asset(s) or grant award. The logos making up the logo strip should be given equal prominence to other logos on the page.
