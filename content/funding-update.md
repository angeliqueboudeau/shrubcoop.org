We are excited to announce that we have been awarded a grant of £7,703.00 from the Scottish Government’s Community Climate Asset Fund.

**What is the CCAF?**

The Community Climate Asset Fund is a Scottish Government fund, administered by Keep Scotland Beautiful, and 279 community-based organisations from across Scotland have been awarded more than £3.2 million of funding to tackle climate change.

Further details from www.keepscotlandbeautiful.org/ccaf

**What does this fund cover?**

An electric cargo bike, fridge and freezer to help the Food Sharing Edinburgh Network to reduce local carbon emissions by reducing emissions for collections and deliveries and diverting more surplus food from landfill.

**The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to have a significant impact on our income.** 

The revenue of the Zero Waste Hub is vital for us to pay for our core costs, including rent and our back-office staff who provide essential support for our projects.

**Your support is still very much in need.** By donating, you can help us to cover some of our core costs and keep our activities going while we wait for the outcome of more funding applications.

We understand that right now, a lot of people are concerned about their own financial situation.

It’s important that you take care of yourself and your family first.
