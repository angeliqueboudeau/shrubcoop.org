**We’re thrilled to announce that the SHRUB Cafe has now reopened for take-away! Tue - Sat, 11am - 6pm**

You can get tasty hot or cold drinks and take-away sandwiches. We’re using donated or repurposed take-away containers and packaging to minimise our carbon footprint. We also have a range of second-hand keep cups for sale (you can bring your own and have it filled with a steaming hot oat latte!).

Looking to the future, we are hoping to start being able to offer a sit-in service once again. We’re taking our time so as to ensure that we’re being as safe as possible for our staff, volunteers, members and the general public. We’d rather take a bit longer and get it right first time round.

We’re looking to shake things up a bit with some new suppliers and products that are more sustainably sourced and locally produced so watch this space!
