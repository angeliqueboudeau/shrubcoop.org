#### **Carrying stuff while cycling!**

Sometimes it can be hard to know where to find information and resources about cycling, and not everyone knows someone they can ask…but what if there was a place you could go to meet other “everyday cyclists” to ask all those questions? Well, we’ve created a space to do just that! We are welcoming new and everyday cyclists to join us in a fortnightly skill-share where we can help you find the information you need to get where you want to go on two wheels!

In this week's session we'll be looking at what do you (or could you) carry on a bike? Join us on Zoom to meet some friendly folks and chat about different ways to carry things while cycling. You're welcome to share your own tips, ask questions or to just listen.

**When?**

Monday 1st February at 5.30-6.30pm, online via Zoom ([here's the link](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fus02web.zoom.us%2Fj%2F85189705884%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1o2R1u8u_9jo0TAPH9-oSM1hYONvsmaVxOwz88bTKpLlyRzyqG95ULsQ4&h=AT33GZfoniNWQ43L2zkkGTbSJtKVNMddgzhRtzZhxYIOiQ8q10csNCj44VWgRBDOluSQ-Mbch2o9gpd8MmXILbw_faVo1WYBCC-NGHPo008hypiZ4Kp2imAARDOWQ3awl9AVWGuzeAzcGva8XoSuAg)).
