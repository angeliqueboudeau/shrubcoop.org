This session will look at the art of Zines and take you through the process of how you can make your own.  
It will be extremely accessible - no experience required. All you need is something to write with and a piece of paper.  
Other things you might find useful are, old magazines, newspapers, coloured pens/pencils, scissors and glue.  
We look forward to getting creative with you!

If you have any questions or accessibility requirements you would like to talk over please email- billie.dunleviewood@shrubcoop.org
