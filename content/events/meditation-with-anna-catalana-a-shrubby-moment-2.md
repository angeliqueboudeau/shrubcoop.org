Take some time to rest and to focus on relaxation.

This session is a led meditation in Kundalini Yoga style by Anna who has studied meditation practices since 2005.

Anna is happy to help us all get through this difficult time with meditation sessions twice a week. Come along and hopefully we can help you to feel a bit better. We all deserve it.

You don't need any special equipment. Just wear comfy loose fitting clothes and please have bare feet.

**When:** Thursday and Sunday evenings at 17.00 - 17.30
