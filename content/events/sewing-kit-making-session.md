As part of our drive to get more people sewing we plan on making over 100 sewing kits that will be distributed to our community. We've got all the contents ready, now we just need to make the kits up!

What to expect:   
We'll be meeting at the Zero Waste Hub from 3pm to 5pm on Tuesday the 7th of February to make the kits and fill them up. We're looking for folks to help with the sewing and packing of the kits. 

There will be sewing machines and expertise on hand as well as a production line for packing them. Any and all help is appreciated!
