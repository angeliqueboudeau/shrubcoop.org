Join us on November 28th for our Annual General Meeting!  
  
It's a time to get together and celebrate the achievements of the year, say goodbye to our current trustees and elect new trustees for the next year ahead  
  
We'll follow this up an after-party, the details of which will be confirmed soon!  
  
[Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yW6OaJtgqNgJvMOXjtP5Kzo3xclgdLNHaNXeGa-vsp8/edit?usp=sharing "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yW6OaJtgqNgJvMOXjtP5Kzo3xclgdLNHaNXeGa-vsp8/edit?usp=sharing")  
  
Please take the time to have a read of the agenda, which also includes a proposal to make a constitutional amendment, regarding staff membership of the cooperative, that will be discussed.
