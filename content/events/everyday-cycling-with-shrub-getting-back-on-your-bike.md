#### **Getting Back on your Bike**

Sometimes it can be hard to know where to find information and resources about cycling, and not everyone knows someone they can ask…but what if there was a place you could go to meet other “everyday cyclists” to ask all those questions? Well, we’ve created a space to do just that! We are welcoming new and everyday cyclists to join us in a fortnightly skill-share where we can help you find the information you need to get where you want to go on two wheels!

Haven't cycled since you were a kid? Or maybe you've had a break from cycling during lockdown? Join us on Zoom to meet some friendly folks and chat about getting back on your bike. You're welcome to share your own tips, ask questions or to just listen. Here's the F[acebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/430170264873507) for more details.

What's everyday cycling? It's our way to describe cycling as a way of getting around, rather than for sport or leisure. Read [Lisa's blog](https://www.shrubcoop.org/sharing-skills-for-everyday-cycling/) to find out more!
