At this time of year, we're often confronted with reminders of the ways consumption and waste shape our collective lives: a fridge full of excess food that we can't possibly eat (or the shop can't possibly sell) before it rots or curdles; a mountain of presents, especially when children and grandparents are involved; and layers and layers of packaging.

At the same time, the start of a new year can bring resolutions, commitments to change some aspect of our life, perhaps to live more sustainably or to find more space to be creative. 

The Waste Stories team and SHRUB Coop are offering you another chance to do both! Following on from our October workshop, which saw the creation and sharing of five fantastic stories, we're bringing together a new set of pictures and objects to help you turn found trash into imaginative treasure.

Tea and coffee will be available.
