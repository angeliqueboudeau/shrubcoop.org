#### **Keeping on top of the weather**

Sometimes it can be hard to know where to find information and resources about cycling, and not everyone knows someone they can ask…but what if there was a place you could go to meet other “everyday cyclists” to ask all those questions? Well, we’ve created a space to do just that! We are welcoming new and everyday cyclists to join us in a fortnightly skill-share where we can help you find the information you need to get where you want to go on two wheels!
