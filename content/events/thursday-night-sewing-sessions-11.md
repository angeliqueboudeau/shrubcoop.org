Are you itching to start any sewing projects? Have you got a well loved item of clothing you want to mend? Come along to our sewing drop-in sessions!

We're opening the doors to our workshop space each week for people of all sewing abilities to meet and get advice.

So whether you've got an upcycling project in mind, need to repair or alter something, or want to just join us for a cup of tea, drop by!

We have sewing machines, tools, and some supplies to use, but if you need specific materials, please bring those along.

No experience necessary!  
FREE entry, donations always welcome
