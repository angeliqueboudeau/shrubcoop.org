It’s time for our AGM again and we invite all of our community, members and volunteers to join!

* Date: Sunday 4th December
* Time: 4pm to 6pm (AGM), after 6pm - party!
* Where: Zero Waste Hub, @ 22 Bread Street

What’s an AGM? An Annual General Meeting is a time to come together to reflect on last year's achievements, look at the strategic vision for the coming year and elect new trustees.

Coming to the AGM is a great chance to get a better idea of how the SHRUB operates and have a say in its direction.

We will have space for everyone to share their opinions, thoughts and ideas. Put your thinking caps on before the day and bring any ideas or questions you might have. 

If you would like to stand for election as a Trustee, please see the application process [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jK7euOrNv8JAGSIKCC8VG3JtO95H1apRDwd0-vaXTY4/edit?usp=sharing)

We are looking for people of all skill sets and backgrounds so don't feel scared to apply!

Everyone is welcome to attend but only members have voting rights. 

This event will take place in person at 22 Bread Street. If you’re unable to attend but would still like to vote, get in touch with us and we can arrange proxy voting for you.

We will have snacks and soft drinks available but feel free to bring your own as well.

After the AGM is over we can have a social and a boogie!

Hope to see you all there :)
