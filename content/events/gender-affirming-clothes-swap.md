This is a Gender Affirming clothes swap in partnership with SHRUB Coop, The Equality Network and Scottish Trans Alliance

Did you get inappropriate clothes or other gendered gifts for Christmas? Or do you just have some old things to swap?

This swap is for trans non-binary people or anyone else who wants to participate

Come down to SHRUB Coop on the 20th of February between 2-4pm to swap some things!  
(Please arrive within the first 15 minutes so that we can get the swapping started!)

Please only bring clean/ usable items that you would be happy to give to a friend ![‚ù§](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tf3/1.5/16/2764.png =16x16)

We hope to have our cafe open with a range of vegan cakes and hot drinks for you to enjoy while you swap (yum!)

Equality Network staff will be at this event with information and badges!

If you have any questions, please contact swapshop@shrubcoop.org
