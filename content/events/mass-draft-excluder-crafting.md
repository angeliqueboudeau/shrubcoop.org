From 7:30pm

###### The SHRUB and the Meadows Share Winterproofing team ([https://www.facebook.com/groups/warmedinburgh](https://www.facebook.com/groups/warmedinburgh "https://www.facebook.com/groups/warmedinburgh")) are collaborating to host a mass crafting session at the Zero Waste Hub. Come along to make draft excluders for yourself and for those living locally who are being affected by the massive increase in heating costs this winter.

As the energy crisis is already hitting hard we’d like to help everyone keep warm while reducing bills. Join us to make a door or window draught excluder for yourself, for a relative or just to practise your sewing skills. We’d like to make extra excluders during or after the workshop so they’ll be available at the Zero Waste Hub for anyone who needs one of those handmade heat saviours.

\- Please bring your own material for the cover and stuffing (fabric, worn off garment, rags, etc.)

\- Beginner friendly

\- Bring the width measurement of doors or windows you wish to pad

No registration needed.

This event is FREE.
