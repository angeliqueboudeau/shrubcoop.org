SHRUB Coop have been working on a Fabric Awareness Booklet so that you can make informed decisions about the fabrics you wear and how to care for them. To help us launch this booklet, we will have guest speakers from some of our favourite sustainable fashion organisations including Mary Beth from Fashion Revolution, Daisy Snow from Jon Snow, and Jessica Howarth from ReMode. This event will also include a presentation of the booklet from some of our sustainable fashion team and a fun quiz in breakout rooms. We are excited to see you there!

**When:** Wednesday 10th March between 7 and 8.30pm

**Where:** Online via Zoom. Check out the [Facebook event](https://fb.me/e/45n8fsb35) for more info!
