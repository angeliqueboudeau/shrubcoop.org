+++
Join our facilitator Jo as she teaches you how to make your very own lino-print that you can use again and again. In a world of throw-away and mass-produced cards why not learn how to create your own personalised art-works that can be given to friends and family.

All the tools and equipment you need to produce your own stamp will be included. This workshop does require the use of sharp crafting tools and as such is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18.

Tea and coffee will be available. Event runs from 6:30 to 8:30pm
