Have you got a well loved item of clothing you want to mend or adjust? Come along to a special sewing session in the Zero Waste Hub!

Open to people of all sewing abilities to meet and get sewing and repair advice.

Feel free to bring items of your own, or browse the collection of preloved clothing in our Swapshop and have a go at adjusting or modifying it!

So whether youâ€™ve got an upcycling project in mind, need to repair or alter something, or want to just join us for a cup of tea, drop by!

We'll have tools, and some supplies to use, but if you need specific materials, please bring those along.

**No experience necessary!**  
**FREE entry,** donations always welcome

We also run regular weekly sewing sessions at SHRUB Space at 17 Guthrie Street where we have a greater range of tools and sewing machines for more complex sewing projects: [https://www.facebook.com/events/2344728149176726/](https://www.facebook.com/events/2344728149176726/ "https://www.facebook.com/events/2344728149176726/")
