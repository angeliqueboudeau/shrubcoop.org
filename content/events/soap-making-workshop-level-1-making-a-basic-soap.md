In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn the basics of how to make your own soap. Our skilled facilitator will guide you through the process in small groups and will be on hand to answer any questions you have. At the end you'll get to take away your very own basic soap bar!

Please bring along your own mold of choice (such as a silicone mold from a home crafts store such as Ali's Cave or a clean plastic container such as an old butter tub or soft cheese tub). The mold should be max. 8-10cm in diameter. Don't worry if you can't find a mold of your own - we will have some spare ones at the workshop. Please also note that you will need to keep the soap (in its mold) flat when you transport it home, so you need a suitable bag to carry it (or be able to just carry it by hand).

Workshops will be held in our fabulous Zero Waste Hub in central Edinburgh and will have a maximum of 12 participants.

Our Home Crafting Workshops, facilitated by a skilled volunteer, will teach you how to make products such as soap, kefir and cheese from scratch and with a zero waste focus. The workshops will be fully interactive, encouraging you to get involved with the process and have lots of fun! You'll come away with your own creation and a new skill!
