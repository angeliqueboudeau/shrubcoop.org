Join us for three Wednesday evening sessions at 6-7pm on 17th March, 24th March, and 31st March to learn how to make a rag rug!

Weâ€™ll send you everything you need and a cup of tea on us!  
Your pack will include: tapestry needle, string, teabag, and scrap fabric (optional*). All you need is a pair of sharp scissors.  
These will be online Zoom events lasting 1 hour each. There will be no pressure to have cameras or microphones turned on.

If there are any concerns about accessibility, please email: billie.dunleviewood@shrubcoop.org

\*If you have plenty of fabric you can use at home already please choose a no fabric ticket.  
If you would like to rescue some fabric from our Swapshop then please choose a 'with fabric' ticket.

These sessions are free to attend. However, if you enjoy the session, learn something and feel you are able to support us through these difficult times, we would be delighted if you would consider making a donation to help us continue our sustainability projects!
