To celebrate the recent success of our funding applications and the relaunch of the Wee Spoke Hub in the new year, we are hosting an online social for new and existing Wee Spoke Hubbers. We'll chat informally about Wee Spoke Hub plans and all things cycling, as well as having a chance to get to know each other and maybe reconnect with old friends. Bring yourself, a drink and some snacks to enjoy! 

When: Friday 6th November 17.30-18.30

Where: Zoom using [this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89577705614?pwd=ek4vTVVXQVpldDdTZUlaYTZCNE9Sdz09)

Hope to see you there!
