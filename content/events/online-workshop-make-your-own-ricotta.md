In this online workshop, you'll learn how to make ricotta using easy to find ingredients at home.

As we can't run our usual workshops from the Zero Waste Hub right now, our skilled facilitator Francesca will guide you through the process via Zoom and you can cook along with us!

We'll be sharing the recipe in advance of the workshop to give you a chance to gather what you need. We'll also share the workshop as a video so you can rewatch it later.

It's FREE to take part
