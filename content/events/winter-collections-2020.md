Bring us your unwanted items!!

  
If you're headed out of the city to travel for Christmas or are looking to clear some space, we have just the solution for you - we will take your unwanted items! We will make sure they are COVID free and give them back out to the community next year in a wonderful Freeshop.  
As we want to give the items away so someone else can get use from them, we do ask that everything is in usable / wearable condition.  
  
Please note there are a few things we are unable to take: electrical items, knives (and other blades), large items of furniture, used bike helmets, mattresses, duvets and pillows.  
  
Collections is an activity we are very passionate about at SHRUB and we can't wait to make it happen this year despite the difficult circumstances. We ask everyone to come wearing a face covering and if there is a queue outside please keep two meter distancing.

**When?**

We are going to run Collections over three dates in November and December:

* Monday 30th November, 12 - 4pm 
* Tuesday 8th December, 12 - 4pm
* Tuesday 15th December, 12 - 4pm

Please bring all items to the SHRUB Space at 17 Guthrie Street where they will be sorted and stored for next year's Freeshop.
