Wednesdays from 12 to 4pm.

Come along to the Zero Waste Hub for our Warm Wednesdays in collaboration with Queer Disabled Spoonies Edinburgh (QDS).

The cost-of-living crisis and fuel poverty are disproportionately affecting disabled people in and around Edinburgh. Our Warm Wednesdays are a space for folk to relax and be warm.

This event is aimed at disabled folk but anyone is welcome to join as long as they are respectful and mindful of others.

This is intended as a space where you can craft, read, write, socialise or simply play with your phone in good company.

QDS will be providing free food and filter coffee for anyone who would like it. They also have a limited supply of community support bags for those in need.
