A message by [ELREC's](https://www.elrec.org.uk/) Conscious Living Project:

"We are very excited to invite you to our board games afternoons at the Zero Waste Hub every first and third Wednesday of the month! As part of the Conscious Living Project, we are very happy to collaborate with SHRUB Coop to make these board games meetings happen.

Come alone, with friends, with your board games, or without to spend these two hours having fun and chill time. The project aims to promote mental health, well-being as well as raise environmental awareness. 

We believe that coming for a relaxing event, meeting new people, and going out from home can have a great impact on our mental health and well-being. Almost all our board games are second-hand and we encourage you to bring your own as well. You don't need to register for the event, just pop in whenever you want!  See you!"

This event runs from 4pm to 6pm. Free. Teas. coffees and soft drinks available.
