#### **Staying safe while cycling!**

Sometimes it can be hard to know where to find information and resources about cycling, and not everyone knows someone they can ask…but what if there was a place you could go to meet other “everyday cyclists” to ask all those questions? Well, we’ve created a space to do just that! We are welcoming new and everyday cyclists to join us in a fortnightly skill-share where we can help you find the information you need to get where you want to go on two wheels!

  
In this week's session, join us on Zoom to meet some friendly folks and chat about different ways to stay safe while cycling. You're welcome to share your own tips, ask questions or to just listen.  
What's everyday cycling? It's our way to describe cycling as a way of getting around, rather than for sport or leisure. Read [Lisa's blog](https://www.shrubcoop.org/sharing-skills-for-everyday-cycling/) to find out more!
