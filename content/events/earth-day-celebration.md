To celebrate Earth Day one of our volunteers, Lisa Heywood, has teamed up with SHRUB to organise an online evening of live music, dancing and poetry. We may not be able to gather for ceilidhs and social dances right now, but that doesn't mean we can't dance our socks off together! Join us on Zoom from 7:45pm to meet up and chat with other SHRUB members in breakout rooms, then from 8-10pm there will be live music and dancing that you can join in with from home. During the interval there will be a live poetry performance and after the dancing there will be more time to chat until 10:15pm.

Wondering how the dancing will work? Check out the event page to find out more! The event is open to the public, but tickets are free for SHRUB members. Just click “Buy Tickets” and then “do you have an access code?” on the ticket page. Please check member communications or get in touch for the access code. Once you’ve registered the details to join will be sent to you by email.
