SHRUB would like to invite you to join us in celebrating a waste free festive period. We will be running a few workshops throughout December.

  
These will be running for a small number of people in our workshop at 17 Guthrie Street AND for those unable to join us in the space, we will be streaming the event online.  
We will be posting about each session in our dedicated [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/969051650287349) beforehand so that if you're joining in at home, you can gather the materials beforehand. Or you can nip in to the workshop and we'll give you a wee kit.

  
We will be taking all of the COVID safety precautions and ask that everyone who comes into the space wears a mask.
