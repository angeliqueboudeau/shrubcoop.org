**It's the most wonderful time of the year!**  
  
But the holidays can also be the most wasteful.  
  
This year we're showcasing ways to enjoy the festivities in a more environmentally friendly way.  
  
Join us for a day of **upcycling and festivity.** We'll be showing you how to:  
  
 • Wrap a gift without the waste!  
 • Customise and personalise special gifts  
 • Make your own upcycled decorations  
  
You love our coffee and you can't wait for more treats from our Café? **Be one of the first to try our new recipes**. You decide which ones make into the new menu. And to warm you up, we will serve you mulled beverages.  
  
**Are you looking for a secret Santa gift?** The Swapshop will be open as usual - why not choose something preloved and even personalise it?  
  
**Time and Date:**  
11am to 5pm  
  
**Location:**  
Zero Waste Hub, 22 Bread Street, EH3 9AF
