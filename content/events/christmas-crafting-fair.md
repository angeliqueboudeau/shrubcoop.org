Do you love crafting?

Are you keen to learn new skills?

Do you love Christmas?

Are you fighting against crass commercialism?

If you answered yes to any of these questions then come on down to the Christmas Craft Fair on Sunday 18th of December in the Zero Waste Hub. 

Starting from 11am we'll have a whole bunch of crafting stalls set up that will change over the course of the day including:

* Card Printing
* Christmas-ify your boring hats and jumpers
* Wreath weaving
* Pom-pom baubles

All crafting is on a by-donation basis.

SHRUB is a sober space with quiet music and low lighting. Noisy sirens do go through the neighbourhood. We do not have a hearing loop installed.
