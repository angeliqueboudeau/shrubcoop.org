Join us in the Zero Waste Hub every Tuesday afternoon to get help mending your clothing or to learn to sew.

Our sewing volunteer, Mary, will teach you the basics and help you tackle fast fashion through the radical act of mending.

We have sewing and mending supplies available as well as a couple of sewing machines. 

This event is FREE.
