We're excited to be hosting a screening and discussion of the David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet film.  
Honest, revealing and urgent, this film is Sir David Attenborough’s witness statement for the natural world - offering a powerful first hand account of humanity’s impact on nature and a message of hope for future generations.  
We'll watch the film together and then have a chat about what we think and what actions we feel motivated to take going forward.

When: Wednesday 11th November at 17.30
