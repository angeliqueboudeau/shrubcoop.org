In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to make your own shampoo from scratch.

Our skilled facilitator Francesca will guide you through the process in small groups and will be on hand to answer any questions you have. At the end you'll get to take away your own handmade shampoo and be equipped with the skills to make it yourself at home!

Workshops will be held in our fabulous Zero Waste Hub in central Edinburgh and will have a maximum of 12 participants.

Our Home Crafting Workshops, facilitated by Francesca Piccoletti, will teach you how to make products such as soap, beauty products and cheese from scratch and with a zero waste focus. The workshops will be fully interactive, encouraging you to get involved with the process and have lots of fun! You'll come away with your own creation and a new skill!
