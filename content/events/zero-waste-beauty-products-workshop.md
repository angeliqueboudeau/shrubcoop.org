In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to make face masks, body scrubs and solid moisturisers, perfect for festive gifts or for pampering yourself!  
  
Our skilled facilitator Francesca will guide you through the process in small groups and will be on hand to answer any questions you have. At the end you'll get to take away your very own face mask, body scrub and solid moisturiser!  
  
Workshops will be held in our fabulous Zero Waste Hub in central Edinburgh and will have a maximum of 12 participants.   
  
Our Home Crafting Workshops, facilitated by Francesca Piccoletti, will teach you how to make products such as soap, beauty products and cheese from scratch and with a zero waste focus. The workshops will be fully interactive, encouraging you to get involved with the process and have lots of fun! You'll come away with your own creation and a new skill!
