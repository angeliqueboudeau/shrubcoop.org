Are you interested in volunteering for SHRUB, become a paying member or simply want to find out more about what SHRUB is all about?

There is a lot to us so whether you are brand new or have been around a while come along and get informed.

Come join other like-minded people, learn a bit about what we do and how we work and discover what volunteer experiences might be available.

If you are a new volunteer and you haven't yet had an induction, please come along and catch the surf!
