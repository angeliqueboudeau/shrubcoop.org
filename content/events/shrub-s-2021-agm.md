Join us at our AGM on **Tuesday 23rd November**, where we'll be looking back at what SHRUB has been doing in the last year and electing our new Trustees to guide SHRUB through the next year, with plenty of time for input from our members.

We're going to run a blended in-person and virtual AGM this year, and are offering 20 places for in-person attendees in our Zero Waste Hub at 22 Bread Street. Places to attend virtually are unlimited.

For in-person attendees, from 5.30-6pm we'll be offering hot and cold drinks plus tasty food from our cafe. This will be followed by the AGM hosted both in-person and virtually between 6-8pm. There'll be time for socialising afterwards until 8.30pm.

Please sign up for tickets via Eventbrite, indicating whether you want to attend virtually or in-person. Hurry if you want to attend in-person as places are limited!
