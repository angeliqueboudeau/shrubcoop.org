Help us design the future of our Swapshop, events and collections!

We are putting together an application for Scottish Government's Climate Challenge Fund to fund our Swapshop, events and collections activity for the next two years.

At this session we will take all the feedback we've received from our Community Consultation, our survey, and our working group meetings, and put it together into a list of outcomes for our funding application.

Help us establish our activities, a timeline, what resources we'll need and how we monitor what we achieve. If you're an experienced Swapshop, Events or Collections volunteer, your insight will be fantastic - but all members of SHRUB are welcome and both creative and practical insights will help us design as good a project as possible.

Please also fill in our survey to help us decide on our activities and show your continuing support for the projects: [https://forms.gle/T8oS6DuS8aemHwVN8](https://forms.gle/T8oS6DuS8aemHwVN8 "https://forms.gle/T8oS6DuS8aemHwVN8")
