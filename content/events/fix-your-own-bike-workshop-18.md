The **Wee Spoke Hub** is a welcoming workshop space where our volunteers and mechanic will help you learn the skills to take care of your bike.

We also have a range of refurbished bikes and used parts for sale.

Come along to the **Fix Your Own Bike** workshops on **Tuesdays & Thursdays, 5pm - 8pm**.

#### **How It Works**

Simply bring your bike along to one of our **Fix Your Own Bike** workshops and our team will check it over and guide you in any repairs it needs.

**Tools and expertise** are provided and participants are welcome to donate what they can. As a member of SHRUB Coop you get **discounts** on parts.

#### Accessibility information

The Wee Spoke Hub workshop space is on the ground floor. There is a step to the toilets and are therefore not wheelchair accessible.

All our toilets are gender neutral.
