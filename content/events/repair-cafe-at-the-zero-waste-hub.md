The [Repair Cafe Edinburgh](https://www.facebook.com/RepairCafeEdinburgh) pop-up returns this April for its first event in central Edinburgh, at the SHRUB Zero Waste Hub! This event is hosted by Repair Cafe Edinburgh, who will be on hand to help you with your repair questions and guide you with your fixes.

So if you want to repair your broken electrical, electronic and mechanical devices such as toys, small electricals, laptops, lamps…you can email Repair Cafe at repaircafeedinburgh@gmail.com to confirm suitability and to reserve your place.

Or just turn up on the day and they will take a look.
