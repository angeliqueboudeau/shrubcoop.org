This Autumn, we are offering a **3-part bike maintenance course**, run by our qualified mechanic, to cover all the things you need to know to **take care of your bike day-to day** and the **repairs** to keep you on the move. See dates and sign up [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bike-maintenance-classes-tickets-76790615799 "here")!

You are welcome to bring your own bike, it will make the learning more relevant and it will get a **safety check** and **new cables and brake pads** as part of the sessions. We also have demo bikes available on request.  
  
At the end of the three sessions, you will be able to confidently identify the different parts of a bike, perform routine checks and maintenance to keep you safe, and check, maintain and change inner tubes, brakes and gears.  
  
And of course, we’ll take care of **snacks and refreshments** during the sessions.

Running order:  
  
**Session 1**, **Saturday Nov. 16th, 10am-1pm**: **Bike mechanics 101:** this first session will cover the very basic bike mechanic notions, you will learn the different parts of the bike, and what to look for when doing a safety check (or M check). You will then move on to take off your wheels to check and repair punctures.   
  
**Session 2, Saturday Nov. 30th, 10am-1pm: Brakes:** in this second session, we will look at the main brake systems and learn to check and maintain them. If you bring your own bike, you will go home with new cables and pads!  
_note: for timing and safety reasons, this session will not cover hydraulic disc brakes.  
_  
**Session 3, Saturday Dec. 14th, 10am-1pm: Gears**: the third session will revolve around gears and everything making them spin. You will learn to check your drivetrain (front and rear cogs and chain), cables and derailleurs, and to maintain them yourself.  
  
The full course price is £150 and SHRUB members get 20% discount for the course. [Sign up through Eventbrite here.]()
