SHRUB Coop is taking its zero waste ethos online!

Join us for our next Sustainable Fashion Zoom call 5:30-7pm. Here is the [Zoom link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/9731735824 "zoom link")

The fashion industry is now the second most polluting industry in the world after oil.

This group explores the environmental impacts of our fashion habits and looks at personal and large solutions in Edinburgh.  So far we have discussed challenges and solutions to the current fast-fashion industry and planned some exciting projects ahead. 

Don't worry if you are new to online meetings. You are welcome to have your camera on or off and we will go through hand signals before hand to make sure everyone feels comfortable in the space and the meeting runs smoothly.

Everyone welcome. Please bring along your enthusiasm, and any interesting facts or ideas you might have. No experience is necessary!

If anyone has any particular topics they would like to discuss please put them in the event discussion on our [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/2700281730218655/?active_tab=about "sustainable fashion meetup"), if not I will update this soon with the topic of the meeting.

If anyone has any queries about accessibility please contact joanne.elston@shrubcoop.org

This event is FREE (donations always welcome).
