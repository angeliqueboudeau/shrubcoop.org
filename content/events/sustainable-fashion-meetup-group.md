The fashion industry is now the second most polluting industry in the world after oil.  
  
If you're interested in learning more about the environmental impacts of our fashion habits and want to help develop sustainable fashion ideas in Edinburgh, then come along and get involved with SHRUB Coop's Sustainable Fashion working group!   
  
In our first meet-up, we discussed challenges and solutions to the current fast-fashion industry and planned some exciting projects ahead! This month we will continue to explore and promote sustainable fashion ideas in Edinburgh.   
  
Everyone welcome.  
  
There will be snacks, smiles and ideas. So please bring along your enthusiasm, and any interesting facts or ideas you might have.  
  
We hope to see you then!   
  
_If you are particularly interested in 'hands-on' workshops and clothing repair, we also run weekly Sewing and upcycling workshops on Thursdays at 17, Guthrie St, 5-7pm._

___*Sustainable Fashion monthly meet-ups are normally on the last Tuesday of each month, but this month it will be on Wednesday*___
