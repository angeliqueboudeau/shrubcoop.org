As a member you're welcome to take part in how our organisation is run!  
  
Every 4 weeks we meet with members, volunteers, staff and representatives from all our working groups for updates on whats going on across the coop.  
  
**Everybody is welcome** - simply come along, listen to the ideas and let us know what you think of them to help us make the best choices we can.

6\.20 - 6.30pm: Updates since last meeting  
6\.30-6.50pm: Discussion or Proposal from community  
6\.50-7pm: Break

This document will be updated with the most recent agenda a week before the meeting - until then you can read here the most recent minutes  
  
Any agenda items should be sent to agenda@shrubcoop.org one week before the meeting date at the latest. If you would like to bring in a discussion topic or a proposal, but don't know how, please contact us at hello@shrubcoop.org and we will provide you with templates and instructions.  
  
This is a great opportunity to have a say in decisions that affect the whole coop, and also a place to learn what is going on across the community. It helps the community identify gaps and work towards our shared goal of community empowerment for a world without waste.
