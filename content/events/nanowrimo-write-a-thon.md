Fridays from 3 to 6pm!

In collaboration with Queer Writers of Edinburgh, the SHRUB is hosting a weekly write-a-thon space for the month of November.

Come and get creative in a collaborative and supportive environment.

There will be a big table booked for the occasion, look for the short tattooed lad with the bright purple hair!

Tea and coffee will be on sale but you are welcome to bring your own beverage/snacks if youâ€™d like. Pens and paper can be provided if needed.

You don't need to be LGBTQIA+ to join NaNoWriMo at SHRUB , but your host is non-binary trans and SHRUB is a queer radical space, so please do remember your manners, don't make assumptions about other people's identity, and do always treat people with dignity and respect.

The session will take place during regular opening hours.

This event is FREE.
