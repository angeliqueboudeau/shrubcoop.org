#### **Cycling in the winter: Edinburgh's Cycle Paths**

Sometimes it can be hard to know where to find information and resources about cycling, and not everyone knows someone they can ask…but what if there was a place you could go to meet other “everyday cyclists” to ask all those questions? Well, we’ve created a space to do just that! We are welcoming new and everyday cyclists to join us in a fortnightly skill-share where we can help you find the information you need to get where you want to go on two wheels!

Do you know it's possible to cycle from Haymarket to Leith on a single cycle path? Edinburgh has loads of cycle routes to explore, some of them well-known, some not. Whether you know Edinburgh's cycle routes well and would like to share your knowledge or are eager to discover new cycling paths, this session is for you!

**When?**

Monday 18th January at 5.30-6.30pm, online via Zoom ([here's the link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85189705884)).

Join the dedicated [Everyday Cycling Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3381216181973515) to be part of our community!

**How much?**

These sessions are free to attend. However, if you enjoy the session, learn something and feel you are able to support us through these difficult times, we would be delighted if you would consider making a donation to help us continue our sustainability projects!
