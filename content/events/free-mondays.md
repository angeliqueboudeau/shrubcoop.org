We want you to have things for free!

We want to save things from a fate in the landfill!

Aaaaaand.....

We want to see your lovely faces (albeit under a mask)!

So we are putting on a new SHRUB event. Free Mondays!

**When**: Monday, 21 September, 2pm

**Where**: Zero Waste Hub, 22 Bread Street EH3 9AF

Everyone is welcome to come and see what stock we have have and simply help themselves.

Can't wait to see you there.

_We will be taking all of the COVID related safety precautions. **Please come with a mask** and we will take care of the rest._
