As many books as we can manage!

We will bring up as many boxes of books as we can covering genres including: 

General fiction, Biography, Arts, Music & Film, Religion, Politics & Environment, Philosophy, History, Popular Science, DIY and Crafts, Sports, Scottish, Health and Self Help, Poetry, Cookbooks, Travel literature and guides, Sci-Fi and Fantasy, Young Adult. 

Due to COVID 19 and social distancing, we will be limiting the number of people we have in the shop at any time. We will try to have books outside for people to look through, and will keep bringing books up throughout the day to make sure everyone can find something.

**When**: 11am - 6pm, Saturday 7th of August

**Accessibility**: The Zero Waste Hub is on ground floor with a small step at the entrance. A ramp is available, just ring the bell and one of our volunteers will happily assist you. All the public spaces throughout the building are step free and there is an accessible toilet with hand rails.

There are disabled parking bays on both parallel streets, East Fountainbridge and Grindlay Street.

All our toilets are gender neutral.
