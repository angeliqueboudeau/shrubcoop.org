Ask us anything, or just pop in for a chat. This session is an informal opportunity to field an idea, ask for clarification, or just to catch up.

SHRUB can be a very busy community and joining all the dots sometimes feels pretty tricky. We might not always have the answers but we'll certainly try to help you find them!

**When:** Every Tuesday lunchtime at 1-2pm

**Where:** Online, on Zoom using [this link](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fus02web.zoom.us%2Fj%2F87306959227%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2QCjGh2uyZL8ec49SItmyRyOlLsJHDjfDhfJhiVCwcx2ds3QIXJjkObr8&h=AT2ARIrIOaUTEDASa0sV5Y7XuYJxUHAQkEQwjEEu5EPVpzrTGe3bBU-MTmWuObp3kdlqdpITqNLtPZSUVpTg5zdSUlC8hsSgyS0f2tCPg7k8g-Z62hgVIqtasxDy6OFmf28yzQGfCCYXEMh7GTd_tA)
