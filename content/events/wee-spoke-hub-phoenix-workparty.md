\*Wee Spoke Hub Phoenix Workparty*

Saturday 5 November 2022 (15:00 - 18:00)  
17 Guthrie Street

Together, we're redefining  
the Wee Spoke Hub space,  
the Wee Spoke Hub way of working,  
the Wee Spoke Hub vision.

Come and join us from 3 to 6 PM!  
Bring your hands,  
Bring your ideas,  
Bring your inclusivity,  
Bring your laughter.

The Wee Spoke Hub is a valuable space in Edinburgh.  
During Lockdown, it was the only safe DIY space. ![ðŸ’ª](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6c/1/16/1f4aa.png =16x16)

We invite your experience, your skills,  
your ideas, as well as your critical scrutiny of ours,  
to help us put Wee Spoke Hub on a long-term sustainable footing.
