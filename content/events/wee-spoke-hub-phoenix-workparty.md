From 3 to 6pm at 13th Guthrie St.

The Wee Spoke Hub (WSH) - our bike shop and repair space - is currently on standby and we need you to help us build a new vision for the space!

If youâ€™re a volunteer, member or simply have used the WSH in the past, join us to get a say on what happens next.

Together, we're redefining

the Wee Spoke Hub space,

the Wee Spoke Hub way of working,

the Wee Spoke Hub vision.

Bring your hands,

Bring your ideas,

Bring your inclusivity,

Bring your laughter.

The Wee Spoke Hub is a valuable space in Edinburgh.

During Lockdown, it was the only safe DIY space. 

We invite your experience, your skills,

your ideas, as well as your critical scrutiny of ours,

to help us put Wee Spoke Hub on a long-term sustainable footing.
