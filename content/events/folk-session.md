The SHRUB folk session returns with the music stylings of Dom, Lewis and Col!

Scotland has a rich musical tradition that tends to be hidden away in pubs. What sets our session apart is that it takes place as a dry event that is open to everyone.

Bring your gran, bring your kids, bring your flatmates, all are welcome!

For those who may not have attended a traditional folk session before: the focus is on joining in, learning and practising. It's totally fine to just sit and enjoy but you're welcome to get stuck in!

Our cafe will be open with hot and cold non-alcoholic drinks available for purchase.
