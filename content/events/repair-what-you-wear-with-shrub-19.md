From 5:30 to 7:30pm

Join us in the Zero Waste Hub every Tuesday afternoon to get help mending your clothing or to learn to sew.

Our FREE drop-in sewing sessions are open to everyone from beginners to experts to meet, share and get advice in the cozy cafe of our second hand shop.

We have sewing machines, tools, and some supplies to use. But if you need specific materials, please bring those along or come in earlier to have a look at the haberdashery section of the shop.

Examples of things we can help you with:

\- mending knitwear

\- mending with regular techniques

\- visible mending with embroidery, sashiko, boro, patchwork

\- adjusting garments to fit better

\- trousers fraying at the crotch, knees, etc

\- fixing a zip, replacing a button

\- using a sewing machine

\- fixing a torn seam

\- upcycling

\- crochet and knitting
