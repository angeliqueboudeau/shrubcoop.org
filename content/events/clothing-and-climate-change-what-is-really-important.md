SUSTAINABLE FASHION SPRING GATHERING

This event is part of Sustainable Fashion Scotland's Spring Gathering: a 3-day series of events happening across Scotland (in-person and online) for fashion and textile practitioners looking to connect, learn and grow with others working to create change in fashion, running 23-25 March. The SFS Spring Gathering is part-funded by Creative Scotland's Open Fund.

ABOUT REPAIR WHAT YOU WEAR

[Repair What You Wear](repairwhatyouwear.com) is a free source of information and mending tutorials designed to positively change our relationship with clothing through education and knowledge. Sewing Survival Skills are taught left and right handed. The repair tutorials range from school uniform mends to complex knit repairs but are accessible to all. RWYR is co-founded by Ros Studd and Elahe Alavi, based in Aberdeen.
