The SHRUB Coop sustainable fashion working group will be holding a Stitch It Don’t Ditch It street event on Saturday 23rd April from 11.30am to 1pm on Castle Street in Edinburgh city centre, to mark Sustainable Fashion Week 2022. There will be a number of sewers, with their mending, sitting on a row of camping chairs displaying their Stitch It Don’t Ditch It banner.

The event is to raise awareness that although the textile industry is responsible for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 20% of global clean water pollution, it is possible to reduce the environmental impact of clothing by repairing garments so that they can be used for longer.

The menders will be sharing sewing skills, discussing options for your repairs and signposting to learning resources for folks who want to start to sew or improve their hand sewing repair skills. So if you want to learn how to thread a needle, secure your thread, fix a seam, sew on a button, get advice about repairing a garment, find out about what’s available locally and online to help you learn how to repair clothing, come along and have a chat.

We already have a few volunteer menders but we’d welcome more so please contact mary@shrubcoop.org if you are interested in joining us.

There will be banner making help available at the Shrub Tuesday afternoon sewing sessions in the Zero Waste Hub, 22 Bread Street between 3pm and 5pm. There’s plenty of recyclable fabric and sewing tools available.
