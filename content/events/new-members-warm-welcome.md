Are you interested in volunteering for SHRUB, become a paying member or simply want to find out more about what SHRUB is all about?

There is a lot to us so whether you are brand new or have been around a while come along and get informed.

Come join other like-minded people, learn a bit about what we do and how we work and discover what volunteer experiences might be available.

If you are a new volunteer and you haven't yet had an induction, please come along and catch the surf!

#### **Accessibility information**

The Zero Waste Hub is on ground floor with a small step at the entrance. A ramp is available, just ring the bell and one of our volunteers will happily assist you. All the public spaces throughout the building are step free and there is an accessible toilet with hand rails.

There are disabled parking bays on both parallel streets, East Fountainbridge and Grindlay Street.

All our toilets are gender neutral.

If you have further questions regarding accessibility, please contact the Zero Waste Hub on **0131 281 0583**.
