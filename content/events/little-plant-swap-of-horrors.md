Do you like plants? Do you like plant-related horror films?

Then this niche event is perfect for you!

We will be hosting a plant swap and film screening of the cult classic, Little Shop of Horrors!

Bring a plant that you've lost your spark with and it can have a home with another plant lover! You can then trade your plant for another plant that someone has brought to swap.

After the swapping has finished, we will watch Little Shop of Horrors. Hot drinks will be available at our cafe!
