#### **Cycling in the winter: don’t let the weather get you down part 2**

Sometimes it can be hard to know where to find information and resources about cycling, and not everyone knows someone they can ask…but what if there was a place you could go to meet other “everyday cyclists” to ask all those questions? Well, we’ve created a space to do just that! We are welcoming new and everyday cyclists to join us in a fortnightly skill-share where we can help you find the information you need to get where you want to go on two wheels!

In this week's session, we will be looking at how to help your bike make it through these dark months. Lots of helpful maintenance tips.

**When?**

Monday 14th December at 5.30-6.30pm, online via Zoom ([here's the link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85189705884)).

We'll be running these sessions on Mondays at 5.30pm on the 30th November, 14th December and 18th January, each covering a different everyday cycling topic.

Join the dedicated [Everyday Cycling Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3381216181973515) to be part of our community!

**How much?**

These sessions are free to attend. However, if you enjoy the session, learn something and feel you are able to support us through these difficult times, we would be delighted if you would consider making a donation to help us continue our sustainability projects!
