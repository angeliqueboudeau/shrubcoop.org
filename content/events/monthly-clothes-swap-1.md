We're hosting our 5th clothes swap! It's an opportunity for you to bring along as many unwanted/ unworn items of clothing and leave with some 'new' things to keep you going until the next one!

#### WHAT?

Clothes swap, bring good quality clothes to hang up

#### HOW?

Please arrive between 2pm-2.30pm. During this time you will be able to hang up the clothes you have brought.   
Once everything is hung up we will invite everyone to pick a couple of items to try on. Once everyone has tried on what they have chosen we will do another round of picking, and so on until everyone is satisfied (or until stock lasts!)

#### WHEN?

Sunday 17th Feb 2-4pm

#### WHERE?

The Zero Waste Hub (Bread Street)

The Zero Waste Hub is on ground floor with a small step at the entrance. A ramp is available, just ring the bell and one of our volunteers will happily assist you. All the public spaces throughout the building are step free and there is an accessible toilet with hand rails.
