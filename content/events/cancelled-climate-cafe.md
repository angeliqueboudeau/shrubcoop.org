Want to find your place in this discussion? Come along to our Climate Cafe to discuss issues and solutions!

SHRUB Coop volunteers are running informal fortnightly sessions in our Zero Waste Hub cafe on Fridays. These will be a place to discuss your role and emotions around climate change as well as having topics and prompt questions to initiate further conversation and action.

Climate Cafes are founded on the idea that action on climate change will increase as more and more people, from a range of backgrounds, start to talk about Climate Change and discuss their questions, concerns, and hopes. The purpose of this group is to share experiences, resources, worries, hopes, and ideas, and to see what emerges when people with shared interests come together to drink some tea or coffee. This is an informal discussion group and will not be a lecture or an informational meeting. It is not about guilt trips or judgment.

All are welcome, regardless of experience, or knowledge, or carbon-footprint. Come and chat!
