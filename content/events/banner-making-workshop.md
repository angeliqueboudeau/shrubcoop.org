SHRUB Coop is hosting a banner making workshop in the Zero Waste Hub. This session will be facilitated by our sustainable fashion volunteers who have a passion for getting folk sewing!

The focus will be on making fabric banners rather than paper or cardboard ones. This could be a banner to take to a protest, or simply to hang in your home.  We will be providing limited material so please do bring along some appropriate fabric if you can. Old cotton or polycotton bed sheets make a great canvas to work on.

Sewing machines, needles, thread and fabric scissors will be available for use. You can buy hot and cold drinks in our cafe too.

This is a free and non-ticketed event but we would appreciate donations for fabric and to support our project going forward.

The event runs from 6:30pm to 8:30pm.

See you there!
