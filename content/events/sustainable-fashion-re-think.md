Hello everyone!

  
We have been running our Sustainable Fashion Working Group for quite a while now and thought now would be a good time to re-think how we want this group to run and what we want its aims and purpose to be in the new year.

  
This has always been a group for exploring topics around the environmental and social impact of the fashion and textiles industry but now that there is a lot more information about this in the news, maybe it is time for the focus of the group to shift.

  
Whether you have come along before or not, anyone who is interested in this group is welcome to come along and help us shape what this group will be looking like in the new year.

**When?**

Thursday 10th December at 6.30-7.30pm

**Where?**

Online, on Google Meet using [this link](http://meet.google.com/vac-ofkg-eay)
