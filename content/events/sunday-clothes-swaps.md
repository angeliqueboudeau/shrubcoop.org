We're running a direct clothes swap on the first Sunday of each month, so you can come and exchange clothes and accessories, and update your wardrobe at no cost to you of the environment!

The cafe will be open for hot drinks (and maybe some delicious vegan baked goods!), so come along for a chill afternoon.

Free entry to members, entry by donation for non-members.

Please arrive within the first 15 minutes so that we can put out all of the clothes and get swapping!
