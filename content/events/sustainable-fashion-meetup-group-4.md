The fashion industry is now the second most polluting industry in the world after oil.  
  
This group explores the environmental impacts of our fashion habits and looks at personal and large solutions in Edinburgh  
If you want to learn more or have some input to give come along and get involved with SHRUB Coop's Sustainable Fashion working group!   
  
So far we have discussed challenges and solutions to the current fast-fashion industry and planned some exciting projects ahead. This month we will continue to explore sustainable fashion ideas in Edinburgh.   
  
Everyone welcome. Free. There will be snacks, smiles and ideas. So please bring along your enthusiasm, and any interesting facts or ideas you might have.  
  
\*If you are particularly interested in 'hands-on' workshops and clothing repair, we also run weekly Sewing and upcycling workshops on Thursdays at 17, Guthrie St, 5-7pm. Please check before hand*
