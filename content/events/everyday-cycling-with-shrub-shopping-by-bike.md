Join us on Zoom to meet some friendly folks and chat about how to keep your bike in good shape! You're welcome to ask questions, share your own tips, or to just come along and listen. The session is open to folks who already cycle as well as those who are interested in giving it a go. 

Got a question you'd like to ask in advance? Post it in the event discussion and we'll try to make sure it gets answered!

What's everyday cycling? It's our way to describe cycling as a way of getting around, rather than for sport or leisure. Read Lisa's blog to find out more!
