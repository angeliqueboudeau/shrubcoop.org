A message from Romaine:

"This Hatha Yoga class is a steadily paced class allowing time to focus on alignment and enjoyment within asanas (postures). Classes will be scalable so whether you want to focus on strength, flexibility or relaxation you can take what you need from each practice.

I welcome yogis of all experience levels, physical abilities, genders and ages to these classes. While this is a physical practice, adjustments can be made to ensure accessibility. If you have any concerns about suitability for you, especially regarding any questions about physical or mental health in your yoga please feel free to get in touch ahead of class for a private chat so we can figure out how I can best support your needs."

This is a 'bring your own equipment event'. The class will take place between 6:30 and 7:30pm
