Feel overwhelmed by climate change?  
Feel like there is so much to learn, and no idea where to start?  
Looking for a community to share and learn?

This month we will be exploring the Circular Economy. We will give space to understand what the circular economy is and how it can be used to build an inclusive economic structure. We will be joined by [Sanitree](https://www.sanitree.org/) to learn more about the circular economy and social justice in practice!

Books are available to borrow from the Zero Waste Hub at any time before the cafe

Our climate cafe is open to everyone, beginners and experts alike

Hot drinks will be available to purchase from our cafe. The session will run from 6pm to 8pm.
