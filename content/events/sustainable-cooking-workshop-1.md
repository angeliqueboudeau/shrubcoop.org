Learn to cook four new recipes from leftovers!

Our Sustainable Cooking Workshops will teach you how to cook Scottish themed, nutritious and delicious zero waste recipes focusing on using local, seasonal produce and leftovers.

The workshops will be fully interactive, encouraging you to get involved in the cooking and have lots of fun!

Alongside this, we'll have a discussion about sustainable food, enabling you to explore ideas around reducing food waste in your everyday cooking and making your food choices more sustainable and healthy.

At the end of the cooking, we'll all sit down together to enjoy the meal!

Workshops will be held in our fabulous Zero Waste Hub in central Edinburgh and will have a maximum of 8 participants.

All recipes are vegan and can be tailored to suit dietary requirements.
