Come and work on a crafty project in the company of some lovely folks. Make a brew and pop in for some nice company. Great if you do have a project on the go but not at all essential - we can also help you to start something new!

**When:**  Every Tuesday evening at 5.30-7pm. Please try and join before 5.40pm so our lovely volunteer Mary isn't waiting too long.

**Where:** Online, on Zoom using [this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/9731735824)

**How much:** These sessions are free to attend. However, if you enjoy the session, learn something and feel you are able to support us through these difficult times, we would be delighted if you would consider making a donation to help us continue our sustainability projects!
