Come down to SHRUB Coop on Sunday the 15th of January between 4.30 and 6.30pm to swap some things!

Did you get inappropriate clothes or other gendered gifts for Christmas? Or do you just have some pre-loved things to swap? This swap is for trans and non-binary people or anyone else and is free for whoever wants to participate.

You can arrive at any time, but we hope to get swapping started in the first 30 minutes. Please only bring clean/ usable items that you would be happy to give to a friend ‚ù§

We plan to have the cafe open with a range of hot drinks and a few snacks for you to enjoy while you swap.

Equality Network staff will be at this event with information and hopefully some badges!
