Come along to the Zero Waste Hub for our Warm Wednesdays in collaboration with Queer Disabled Spoonies Edinburgh (QDS).

The cost-of-living crisis and fuel poverty are disproportionately affecting disabled people in and around Edinburgh. Our Warm Wednesdays are a space for folk to relax and be warm.

This is intended as a space where you can craft, read, write, socialise or simply play with your phone in good company.

QDS will be providing free food and filter coffee for anyone who would like it. They also have a limited supply of community support bags for those in need.

Our venue is located near bus stops served by the following routes: 2, 35, 34, 16, 11, 24, 12, 10, 36, 47. There is limited on-street parking and paid parking on Castle Terrace (roughly 300 metres away by foot on partially cobbled path or 400+ via flatter paved paths).  
Our venue has an accessible toilet (not a changing places toilet) and is laid out such that access is allowed for wheel-chair users. There is one small step at the entrance of our venue and we have a ramp that can be placed down upon request. We do not have a hearing loop installed. Please contact us directly with any accessibility queries and we will respond as quickly as possible: hello@shrubcoop.org.
