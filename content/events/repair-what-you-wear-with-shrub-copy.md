We're opening the doors to our workshop space for people of all sewing abilities to meet and get advice.

So whether you've got an upcycling project in mind, need to repair or alter something, or want to just join us for a cup of tea, drop by this Tuesday.

We have sewing machines, tools, and some supplies to use, but if you need specific materials, please bring those along.

FREE entry, donations always welcome
