Hosted by Lewis Williamson, this folk session is a dry space and completely child-friendly. We aim to make our folk sessions to be accessible to as wide a range of cultures and ages as possible.  
  
The Zero Waste Hub Cafe will be open late serving our full range of hot drinks, soups, sandwiches, and sweet treats!  
  
So whether you're a seasoned folk connoisseur, own your own fiddle, or completely new to the genre, come along, sit back and enjoy the music with a hot drink.  
  
Are you a performer?  
Yes? Then grab your instruments and had on down. Performers can expect be kept fueled with hot drinks and snacks throughout.
