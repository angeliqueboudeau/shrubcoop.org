#### How COVID-19 is affecting SHRUB Coop

To do our part to help flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic, we've temporarily closed all public activities until further notice. This is having a big impact on our income.  
  
We understand that right now, a lot of people are concerned about their own financial situation. It's important that you take care of yourself and your family first.  
  
If you enjoy the session tonight, learn something or feel you are able to support us through these difficult times, we would be delighted if you would consider making a donation.
