Interested in becoming a SHRUB Trustee but want to know more before applying?

We will be hosting two Trustee information sessions on **Friday 12th November** and **Tuesday 16th November**, both at **6-7.30pm**, where you will be able to find out more about SHRUB Coop, the different Trustee roles we have available and how to apply to be a Trustee at our upcoming AGM.

Lead by our current Convenor, Izi, there will be time for lots of questions. Please arrive promptly and email [izi.robe@shrubcoop.org](mailto:izi.robe@shrubcoop.org) to let us know which session you will be attending.

The sessions will be held online via Zoom and the link for Tuesday's session is [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85936922280?pwd=ZmxYd01YQjVNb0FHTmcwYlNkeHRsZz09).

We look forward to welcoming you to our community!
