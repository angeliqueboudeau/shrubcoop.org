Join us for four Tuesday evening Crafting sessions at 6.30pm on 27th July, 10th August, 24th August and 7th September to feel those festival vibes!

We will provide everything you need!

If you are joining from home then you can pick up the materials you need from the Zero Waste Hub and if you are joining us at Bridgend Farmhouse then we will have all the resources ready for you there.

This will be an event that you can attend either on Zoom or in person at Bridgend Farmhouse in the poly tunnel. If there are any concerns about accessibility, please email: billie.dunleviewood@shrubcoop.org
