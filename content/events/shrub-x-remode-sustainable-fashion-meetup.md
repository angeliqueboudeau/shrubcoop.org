SHRUB Coop is taking its zero waste ethos online!  
  
Join us for our next Sustainable Fashion Zoom call on Wednesday 5:30-7:30pm.  
  
Excitingly, this session we will be joined by Monica and Chiara from Remode Collective to explore ways to re-purpose textiles and build new skills whilst celebrating multicultural diversity.  
  
Don't worry if you are new to online meetings. You are welcome to have your camera on or off and we will go through hand signals before hand to make sure everyone feels comfortable in the space and the meeting runs smoothly.   
  
The fashion industry is now the second most polluting industry in the world after oil.  
  
This group explores the environmental impacts of our fashion habits and looks at personal and large solutions in Edinburgh  
If you want to learn more or have some input to give come along and get involved with SHRUB Coop's Sustainable Fashion working group!   
  
So far we have discussed challenges and solutions to the current fast-fashion industry and planned some exciting projects ahead.  
  
Everyone welcome.   
  
Please bring along your enthusiasm, and any interesting facts or ideas you might have.  
  
This event is FREE (donations always welcome)
