We're hosting our 4th clothes swap! It's an opportunity for you to bring along as many unwanted/ unworn items of clothing and leave with some 'new' things to keep you going until the next one!  
  
WHAT?   
Clothes swap   
  
HOW?   
Please arrive between 2pm-2.30pm. During this time you will be able to hang up the clothes you have brought.   
Once everything is hung up we will invite everyone to pick a couple of items to try on. Once everyone has tried on what they have chosen we will do another round of picking, and so on until everyone is satisfied (or until stock lasts!)  
  
WHEN?   
Sunday 24th of November, from 2pm-5pm  
  
WHERE?   
Zero Waste Hub (Bread Street)
