We will continue to operate the food sharing hub as an essential shop throughout the Lockdown starting January 2021.

We hope to offer the same variety of fresh fruits and vegetables as well as baked goods and bread with the occasional cut flowers, but with slightly reduced opening hours.

We will be open Monday to Saturday 11am to 2pm

While we prefer card payment we can take cash as well.
