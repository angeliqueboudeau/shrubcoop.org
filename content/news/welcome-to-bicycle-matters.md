The Bicycle Matters Events programme is here!

Over the next few months we’ll be hosting a range of events and workshops to focus on the waste materials from abandoned bikes in an effort to find new creative uses for them.

For this series of Material Matters, we have in store for you:

* Tailored **bicycle repair sessions**, with our friends at the Wee Spoke Hub – to get old bikes back on the road and save them from going to waste
* Thought provoking bicycle-themed **film screenings** – enjoy some free popcorn and let your imagination run (or ride..) away. Feel free to hang out with us after viewing to share your ideas.
* **Upcycling workshops** to give a second life to waste materials by transforming them into something entirely different.

If that rings your bell (the puns will end soon), pick up a programme at any of our venues or download this handy [PDF ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13AflfNw4Vp_abaVj0el-s04MMtH2TD6q/view?usp=sharing)version for keeps.
