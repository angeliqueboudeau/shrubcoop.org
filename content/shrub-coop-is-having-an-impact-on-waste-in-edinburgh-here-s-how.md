Over the past 2 years, we've been tackling climate change on a community level by reducing waste and consumption practices in Edinburgh. SHRUB has come a long way in this time and we hope to go much further with renewed funding for a further 2 years to run our Swapshop, events and workshops, and the annual End of Term Collections from student halls.

Many individuals now know SHRUB as the vibrant and immersive community to talk about and find new innovative ideas to tackle the ecological crisis together.

#### We are proud to say in the past two years SHRUB has:

* Doubled the staff and projects in our organisation.
* Found a new home and community at our thriving Zero Waste Hub which has become an engaging and important space for this community.
* Started the first Rescued Food Supermarket in Scotland (known as the Food Sharing Hub).
* Saved over **600t of Co2e savings** across our projects:
