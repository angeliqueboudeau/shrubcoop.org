testimonial = "I felt welcomed and trusted from the start, everyone helped me realize my ideas about workshops and after the first one, soap making, I was incredibly happy to see everyone smiling and going home with their own soap, freshly made, like they just discover a beautiful treasure. It was incredible how much positivity was enclosed in something so simple and small like a bar of soap."
block_quote = "The SHRUB has been like a home far away from home for me. Iâ€™m a traveller, and I travel with my backpack of skills and experiences. When I moved to Edinburgh, I was looking for a place where I could share my passion about self-sustainability with other people, and the SHRUB gave me the perfect opportunity to do so."
