block_quote = "I love the people here and interacting with them. I work in a bank so it’s very enclosed - here it’s a much more open community. The first time I came here I was a customer, and automatically everyone was so friendly and welcoming, even for people new to environmental issues. I learn so much from the people here. SHRUB does excellent and important work. It’s a very cool place."
