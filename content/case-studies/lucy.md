testimonial = "I studied environmental sciences at Edinburgh and I started volunteering with SHRUB to get involved with the community and make a difference. I participated in different areas of SHRUB, from Food Sharing Edinburgh to the Marchmont End of Term Collections, and I enjoyed discovering what I was interested in. It has helped me figure out my next steps into my future.\n\nI gained professional skills that I might not have learned at university. I was able to lead a project and organise events, I was able to facilitate workshops and teach skills that I had learned. My time at SHRUB has been invaluable and I don’t think I would be as confident as I am now if I hadn’t been part of it. SHRUB also allowed me to meet people with the same attitudes as me and same point of views, it made me feel less alone and excited to be part of the community."
