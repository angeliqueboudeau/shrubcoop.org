testimonial = "Mary joined SHRUB recently after completing online climate courses that made her keen to take action. She volunteered with our end-of-term collections and Freshers Freeshop, participates in our monthly Sustainable Fashion meetings and clothes swaps, and has been a valuable mentor to those learning to sew and mend at our sewing and clothing repair sessions."
block_quote = "Volunteering at SHRUB makes me feel that I’m doing something positive to combat the climate and ecological emergency and helping others to do so too. I really enjoy discussing sewing and mending projects with people who know what they want to achieve but aren’t sure how to get there… SHRUB provides the infrastructure to support individuals to do more than they could do on their own to live a sustainable life… It enables learning together... fosters a spirit of community, acceptance and inclusion, and reduces social isolation."
