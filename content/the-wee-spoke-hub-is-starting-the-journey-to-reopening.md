![](https://res.cloudinary.com/shrub-co-op/image/upload/v1568759594/shrubcoop.org/media/Untitled_design_biphum.png)Thanks to a grant of £2,000 from Cycling UK we’ll be offering a **FREE Cycle Repair Scheme** - aiming to help people “get on their bike” again. How does it work?

1\. Dig that trusty old clunker out from the cupboard or shed

2\. Check the[ full process, terms and conditions](https://res.cloudinary.com/shrub-co-op/image/upload/v1602775388/shrubcoop.org/media/Cycle_Repair_Scheme_at_Wee_Spoke_Hub_dnl4v3.pdf) of the Cycle Repair Scheme

2\. Book a Repair slot with us

3\. Get your bike fixed by our mechanic

4\. Pick up when it’s ready

_Please note that this scheme is designed to help people who would not otherwise be able to afford to repair their bikes. As the availability of this scheme is limited, please consider allowing those with less means to benefit from this scheme if you can afford to pay for your repair._

We will soon be reopening our doors to the public with new Covid-19 safety measures in place for our famous **Fix Your Own Bike** workshops and **other exciting bike-focused activities**, thanks to a grant from Paths for All. Follow us on social media and subscribe to our newsletter to stay in the loop about dates for these!

We would like to thank the SHRUB volunteer funding team, Truffle Pig consultants, our funders at Cycling UK and Paths for All and our community for their help in making Wee Spoke Hub’s reopening possible!
