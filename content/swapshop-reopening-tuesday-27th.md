GREAT NEWS! The Swapshop will re-open on Tuesday 27th April.

***

Alongside the Food Sharing Hub we will be open 11 to 6, Tuesday to Saturday.

We cannot wait to see you all again!

Our **Swapshop Donations** drop off box will be ready and waiting for your donations. **For the first month we will only be able to accept donations from Shrub members** - but don't worry! You can sign up with us in person on arrival and we can hopefully do this outside.

**We ask all members to pre-sort their bags as much as they can** and **make sure any rags are clearly marked** as a rag bag to save volunteers time in this busy period.

We will be maintaining many of the precautions we're all so used to now.  In our Shrub community we want to focus on physical distancing NOT social distancing. **We ask all customers to follow our 2m floor markings** and we will **allow 10 people into Shrub at a time** to keep everyone lurgy free, those that can **must** wear a face mask inside.

On the positive side of things - **our changing rooms will be open.** We have set up some precautions to keep the space ventilated, and there will be somewhere to put tried on items that you've decided aren't for you.

Unfortunately due to the space constraints involved with physical distancing we will be unable to reopen our cafe straight away.  We will be working on plans and schemes to get it up and running as soon and as safely as possible.

We look forward to creating a world without waste together.

Love,

Shrub Coop crewðŸ¥°
