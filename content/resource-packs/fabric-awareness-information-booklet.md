Have you ever wondered about the textiles your clothes are made from? Do you know which fibers are natural and which are synthetic?

This booklet should help you to know a bit more about different kinds of fibres and the pros and cons of each. There is a lot more information out there than just in this book so feel free to do your own research and make your own decisions about what you want to support/buy
