The aim of this guide is to help you set up a swap shop in an already existing community space. 

A swap shop can be a great way of bringing a community together as it encourages swapping between people within the community. It can be really nice when you find something new, to hear about the story of where it came from, and it can often be easier to part with things if you know where they are going.
