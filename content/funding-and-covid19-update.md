#### We've been awarded another 2 years of funding through the Climate Challenge Fund!

This is a very important first step for our [funding strategy](https://www.shrubcoop.org/can-you-help-us/) going forward and its the result of a huge amount of hard work from our funding team. **Thank you to everyone involved.**

During the summer in 2019, we undertook a community consultation to find out what you as members wanted the cooperative to focus on over the next few years. As a result of this, in November, SHRUB applied for a further 2 years of funding through the Climate Challenge Fund to continue some of our very valued activities.

#### What does this fund cover?

**The Swapshop**  
Over the coming months, this funding will enable us to expand our opening hours to 6 days per week.

**End of Term Collections and Freshers Freeshop**  
We'll be continuing and improving our collections activities, creating resources for other universities to run their own collections elsewhere, and expanding our well-established Freeshop with a range of extra engagement activities.

**Workshops and Events**  
We'll be running a lot more events in the Zero Waste Hub including our much loved Sustainable Fashion programme and repair cafe-style drop-in sessions.

#### So where do we stand now?

**Securing CCF funding is a huge achievement**. It means that at least some of our activities will continue for another two years.

**But we're not there yet.** We're still working hard to secure the future of the Wee Spoke Hub and Food Sharing Edinburgh.

**The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to have a significant impact on our income.** The revenue of the Zero Waste Hub is vital for us to pay for our core costs, including rent and our back-office staff who provide essential support for our projects.

**Your support is still very much in need.** By donating, you can help us to cover some of our core costs and keep our activities going while we wait for the outcome of more funding applications.

We understand that right now, a lot of people are concerned about their own financial situation.

It's important that you take care of yourself and your family first.
