Let's turn Black Friday Green!

A lot of us associate Black Friday with everything that is wrong in our high-consumption, profit driven, capitalist society. While this may not be wrong, since we haven't managed to stop it from happening yet, why not see if we can use it for environmental good?

A huge barrier to buying eco-friendly alternatives has always been price. It is more expensive than many people can afford to buy a set of period pants or a safety razor, creating accessibility issues in the world of modern low-waste products. While we are definitely not encouraging buying new things unless you actually need them and will use them a lot, maybe using this Black Friday to buy something that will ultimately help you live a lower waste lifestyle is not such a bad thing?

It can be easy to see all of the bad things going on in the world, and while we think it is important to recognise what is wrong with them, until we manage to change the system, maybe we need to find ways of making the system work towards our goals and even out some of the inequalities in society if it is possible.
