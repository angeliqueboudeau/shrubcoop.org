**We need your vote to help us re-open the Wee Spoke Hub!**

You have until the 12th of March to vote for the Wee Spoke Hub to receive a grant from the Edinburgh Community Climate Fund!

The City of Edinburgh Council has created a fund to help communities develop sustainable projects. As part of our efforts to make Edinburgh a greener city, we want to re-open the [Wee Spoke Hub](https://www.shrubcoop.org/working-groups/wee-spoke-hub/) doors once again and continue offering tools and expertise to those experiencing barriers to cycling.

Our staff and volunteers have been working hard to make this [project](https://yourvoice.edinburgh.gov.uk/budgets/1/investments/53) a reality, and now we need your support! Residents of Edinburgh have five votes to use (you can only vote once for each project). [VOTE HERE](https://yourvoice.edinburgh.gov.uk/budgets/1#phase-3-public-vote).

_Please note: The community projects have diverse aims, please consider_ [_all the projects_](https://yourvoice.edinburgh.gov.uk/budgets/1/investments) _before making your final decision, and we hope the Wee Spoke Hub will be one of them!_
