![](https://res.cloudinary.com/shrub-co-op/image/upload/v1577901453/shrubcoop.org/media/cafe_blog_1_sonu7a.png)Tuesday 7th January. That’s the date for your diaries. The official reopening of the Zero Waste Café at 22 Bread Street.

After an organic start for the café a year ago, with a few cups of coffee made on the office kettle (the way all great things seem to start here at SHRUB Coop), we are finally ready to get things going to feed our growing zero-waste family.

Lead by our new Café Coordinator, Alun, the community café will be open from 12pm to 5pm between Tuesday and Saturday, with a fully [vegetarian and vegan menu](https://www.shrubcoop.org/working-groups/zero-waste-hub/). Enjoy our delicious **overnight oats**, hearty **vegan sandwiches** and **soups**, and plenty of **cakes** of course, all while helping to fight climate breakdown. Oh, and we don't charge extra for vegan milks (tell your friends)!

Like all the things we do, we’re aiming for our café to be zero waste too! That means no disposable coffee cups and working to eliminate plastic packaging from our supply chain. We can’t promise we’ll be 100% zero waste from the start, but we can promise that every choice and decision we make will be consciously made to eventually get us there. And that’s where these blog posts come in! Throughout our journey to becoming a zero waste café, we’ll be documenting the challenges and triumphs along the way to share with other businesses and home cooks. How do you make the perfect plastic free panini from start to finish? We’re not sure yet, but we soon will, and we’ll share the tips and tricks here.

So there you go, it’s written in a blog post now so it must be happening. We’d like you to join us on our journey towards zero waste and we’ll be asking for your ideas each step of the way. It's not going to be easy, and we won’t always get it right, but we want to have an honest conversation about waste.

We can’t wait to start this journey and feeding you all delicious food along the way. Here we go 2020!
