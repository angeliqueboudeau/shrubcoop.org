#### Since 2013 we have…

* Saved over **1,700 tonnes of carbon** from being added to the atmosphere. That’s the equivalent of **11,000 flights** from Edinburgh to London
* Supported **hundreds of volunteers** to gain new skills and confidence
* Educated **thousands of people in Edinburgh** to repair and reuse things instead of needlessly throwing them away
* Created a **special community** and friendships that will last a lifetime
