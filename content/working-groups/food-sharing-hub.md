The Food Sharing Hub is **Scotland’s first rescued food shop** and exists to save surplus food from supermarkets from an unnecessary fate in the bin.

It's open for everyone. Simply come along to the Food Sharing Hub. Fill a basket with food and **pay as you feel**.

**We're open 11am to 2pm Monday to Saturday During Lockdown**

#### How it works

The Food Sharing Hub is working with a host of local supermarkets via Fareshare and Neighbourly to rescue surplus food that might otherwise end up in landfill.  We get a lot of fresh produce - **fruits and vegetables**, as well as **bread and baked goods** that are still tasty and safe to eat past their 'best before'. We also get seasonal products that shops need to clear away, dented tins, cut flowers and all sorts of surprises.  

We use cargo bikes wherever possible to collect food and to distribute it to partner organisations.  While we have two cargo bikes ourselves we also work with [Cargo Bike Movement]() and their fleet of bikes.  In the evenings [Refugee Community Kitchen Edinburgh]() help to sort and organise the incoming stock - some of which they take to turn into tasty chutneys, jams and preserves

Food Sharing Edinburgh also coordinates a network of food collections from small businesses and redistribute it to charities across the city.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/shrub-co-op/image/upload/v1616663511/shrubcoop.org/media/IMG_20200919_111730_fevrho.jpg)

### Our Impact

We are currently saving an average of **1.28 tonnes** of food through the food sharing hub per month - that's a saving of **6.06 tonnes** of carbon equivalent.

**Food Sharing Edinburgh** has saved **48.9 tonnes** of food in total between Dec 2017 and June 2019. Much of this is redistributed from small businesses directly to charity partners.

Each year, **one-third** of all food produced for human consumption worldwide goes to waste. This is approximately 1.3 billion tonnes. _(FAO, 2019)_

In central Edinburgh, **27.1 tonnes** of food goes to waste every week - that's the equivalent of roughly **54,000 meals** unnecessarily thrown in the bin. _(Zero Waste Edinburgh, 2017)_
