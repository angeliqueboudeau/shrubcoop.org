We are also open between 10.30am and 5.30pm on Mondays so please swing by!

At the Wee Spoke Hub, we aim to help make cycling affordable, attractive and accessible mode of transport for everyday use. Because of this, we have introduced an Accessible Tiered Pricing System, to allow us to operate in line with our core values.

**Tiered System**

Tier 1 - @cost (75% of our published prices) for those unemployed or on less than Scottish Living Wage of £9.50 an hour.

Tier 2 - @ 90% of our published prices for those under Scottish Median Wage of £24897 per annum.

Tier 3 - @ 100% of industry standard with the option to donate more in support of our community and outreach programmes for those earning Scottish Median Wage of £24897 per annum or above.

Tier 4 - If you are in the top 1%, then we’ll charge you a flat £1k for your bike repair or refurbished bike! All profits will go to supporting our outreach work and helping those in need get up and running on 2 wheels!
