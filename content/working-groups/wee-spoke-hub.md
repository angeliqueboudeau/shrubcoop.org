The Wee Spoke Hub is a welcoming workshop space where tools and expertise are provided by our volunteers and mechanic to help you learn the skills to take care of your bike.

We also have a range of refurbished bikes and second hand parts for sale. As a member of SHRUB Coop you get **discounts** on parts.

We are starting to reopen our doors to the public following some new incoming funding and Covid-19 safety adjustments. In September 2020 we were awarded a grant of £2,000 from Cycling UK to offer a **FREE Cycle Repair Scheme** - aiming to help people “get on their bike” again. Check out [this guide](https://res.cloudinary.com/shrub-co-op/image/upload/v1602775388/shrubcoop.org/media/Cycle_Repair_Scheme_at_Wee_Spoke_Hub_dnl4v3.pdf) to give you more information about the scheme.

The Wee Spoke Hub is part funded by Smarter Choices Smarter Places, which is Paths for All’s programme to increase active and sustainable travel throughout Scotland. The programme is grant-funded by Transport Scotland. Furthermore, we have recently been awarded funding from the Gannochy Trust and a REACH Grant from the Bank of Scotland Foundation. This funding is enabling us to restart our much-loved **Fix Your Own Bike** workshops and offer some exciting new cycle-focused activities in the new year - keep your eye on this page, our social media and newsletter for information about dates for these activities and workshops coming soon!

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What Covid-19 safety precautions are we taking?

Before reopening, we are implementing comprehensive Covid-19 safety assessments and adjustments in the Wee Spoke Hub, including introducing hand sanitizer stations, social distancing measures, a one way system and limiting the number of people in the space at once. Everyone entering the Wee Spoke Hub will be asked to wear a face covering unless exempt, and our mechanic and volunteers will all be wearing face coverings.
