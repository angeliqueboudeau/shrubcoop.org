The Wee Spoke Hub is a welcoming workshop space where tools and expertise are provided by our volunteers and mechanic to help you learn the skills to take care of your bike.

We have a range of refurbished bikes and second hand [parts for sale](https://www.shrubcoop.org/wee-spoke-hub-price-list/) and we are currently available for bike repair bookings so drop our wonderful Mechanic, Anna, an email to arrange a slot at weespokehub@shrubcoop.org.

At the Wee Spoke Hub, we aim to help make cycling affordable, attractive and accessible mode of transport for everyday use. Because of this, we have introduced an Accessible Tiered Pricing System, to allow us to operate in line with our core values.

**Tiered System**

Tier 1 - @cost (75% of our published prices) for those unemployed or on less than Scottish Living Wage of £9.50 an hour.

Tier 2 - @ 90% of our published prices for those under Scottish Median Wage of £24897 per annum.

Tier 3 - @ 100% of industry standard with the option to donate more in support of our community and outreach programmes for those earning Scottish Median Wage of £24897 per annum or above.

Tier 4 - If you are in the top 1%, then we’ll charge you a flat £1k for your bike repair or refurbished bike! All profits will go to supporting our outreach work and helping those in need get up and running on 2 wheels!

***

We are excited to offer some new cycle-focused activities as Covid-19 restrictions ease over the next few months - keep your eye on this page, our social media and newsletter for information about dates for these activities and workshops coming soon!
