We are an Edinburgh-based bike shop with a difference!

What do we do?

* We sell second-hand and brand new bike parts.
* We have trained mechanics and volunteers who can fix your bike.
* We repair bikes that have been donated and sell them on at a reasonable price.
* We run DIY bike repair sessions where you can learn to fix your bike yourself.

What makes us different?

* We are an inclusive bike space.
* We take the environmental impact into consideration for every decision we make.
* We have an Ethical Pricing System which means we are deliberately inexpensive compared to many other retailers.
* We are a non-profit organization, so any money we make goes back into the community.
* We put people and planet first.
