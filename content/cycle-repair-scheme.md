**WEE SPOKE HUB**

**The Wee Spoke Hub is a project of** [**SHRUB Cooperative**](https://www.shrubcoop.org/)**.**

We have been funded since around 2014 to provide a space and time for people to learn how to maintain their bikes, a distinctly non-sexist, supportive community advocating for sustainable active travel modes in and around south central Edinburgh. Our last lot of funding ran till March 2020 when the global Coronavirus Pandemic closed lots of community-led initiatives down.

In September 2020 we were awarded a grant of £2,000 to offer a **FREE Cycle Repair Scheme** - aiming to help people “get on their bike” again. So dig that trusty old clunker out from the cupboard or shed and get in touch with our Qualified Mechanic to book a Repair slot.

Simply email [**weespokehub@shrubcoop.org**](mailto:weespokehub@shrubcoop.org.uk) saying what state it is in and giving your contact details.

We then email you a date & time to Drop Off at **Wee Spoke Hub, 13 Guthrie St, Edinburgh EH1 1JG** - between Chambers St and Cowgate. This will generally be **Tuesdays between 6.00pm - 8.00pm** and **Sunday between 1.00pm - 5.00pm**.

When you drop off your bike, we’ll ask you what you want fixed and will carry it out up to the value of £50. If the repair will cost more than £50 we will then contact you to tell you what else is there to do, give you a quote and check if you want it done. When repairs are done we’ll email you to arrange a Pick Up time!

### [**Scotland Cycle Repair Scheme -**](https://www.cyclinguk.org/scotland-cycle-repair-scheme-faqs#faq-What-is-the-Scotland-Cycle-Repair-Scheme?) **Some key Terms & Conditions**

* There is a limit of **£50 free servicing** per bicycle until we’ve used up our allocation.
* There is a limit of one bicycle per person; but you can[ take in bikes for others, ](https://www.cyclinguk.org/scotland-cycle-repair-scheme-faqs#faq-Can-I-take-in-bikes-for-others?)For example, someone could bring in their own bike and bikes for their children and / or partner.
* The only thing Cycling Scotland - who are managing the Scheme - ask is that you complete two short email surveys after the repairs so they can demonstrate the benefits of the scheme.
* Basic service and essential mechanical repairs are covered by the scheme i.e. repairs that are necessary to make the cycle roadworthy and fit for purpose. The following repairs / transactions are NOT covered:
  * a sale of replacement parts without any repair work, including accessories
  * replacement or upgrade of existing safe and roadworthy components
  * replacement or repair of removable lighting accessories
  * any repairs to e-bike electronic units.
* Please note that Wee Spoke Hub can only offer essential servicing and cannot help with electric bikes or hydraulic disc brakes or tubeless tyres;
* **The Scheme is designed to help people who cannot afford to repair their bikes**. If you can afford to pay for your repair, please consider doing so to allow those with less means to benefit from this scheme as availability is limited. Either way you are helping a charity get back on its feet.
* You can find full Terms & Conditions for the Scheme [here](https://www.cyclinguk.org/scotland-cycle-repair-scheme-faqs)

# **Standard Wee Spoke Hub Cycle Service - £30**

If you just want a check-up and general maintenance, this is what you get:

* Checking and adjusting brakes and gears
* Checking chain for wear and lubricating as required
* Checking and replacing worn tyres and / or inner tubes
* Checking frame and forks for damage or other issues
* Test Ride to ensure all running safely

Please note that the £30 service is simply the labour costs and does not include parts. If required we will use the other £20 for the parts needed - we will ask you what to prioritise when you bring the bike in.
