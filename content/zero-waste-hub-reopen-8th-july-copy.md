As the Government announced Phase 2 can go ahead Shrub Coop is excited to confirm we will reopen our Zero Waste Hub on July 8th!

We are SO looking forward to welcoming back our community and making sure all our volunteers, members and customers are safe in our Hub.

Our community's safety is at the heart of Shrub as we adjust to this new world. To keep you in the loop here are some updates for now:

As sit-down cafes are not allowed to reopen in Phase 2, **we will not have our cafe running straight away**. We will be expanding our Swapshop and Food Sharing Hub into the cafe area for the next month or so. We hope our Cafe will be back up and running as soon as it is possible!

We are currently **making 50 masks** for all of our volunteers and staff in the next two weeks! If you would like to help us, please drop us a message at Sydney.chandler@shrubcoop.org

There will be a **Swapshop Donations** drop off box at the front of the Hub either outside or just inside the door from July 8th. **For the first month we will only be able to accept donations from Shrub members** - but don't worry! You can sign up with us in person on arrival and we can hopefully do this outside.

**We ask all members to pre-sort their bags as much as they can** and **make sure any rags are clearly marked** as a rag bag to save volunteers time in this busy period.

In our Shrub community we want to focus on physical distancing NOT social distancing. **We ask all customers to follow our 2m floor markings** and we will **allow 10 people into Shrub at a time** to keep everyone lurgy free. **Changing rooms will also be closed.** This still means we are up for a chat though! Never feel you have to buy something to swing by Shrub.

We hope to get our tokens to you as soon as possible! However as we will need to quarantine donations for at least 3 days before sorting, we ask you to bare with us as we process these. **We will aim to get your tokens with you within 2 weeks maximum**

All volunteers will be given a mask and updated on our safety processes upon arrival. If you would like to help Shrub and volunteer with us at this time, feel free to drop us a message: hello@shrubcoop.org

Our Reopening Countdown has begun!

We look forward to creating a world without waste together. 

Love,

Shrub Coop crewðŸ¥°
