An exciting opportunity has arisen to join the staff team at SHRUB Coop! We’re looking for someone who’s pro-active, passionate about the environment and has a background in hospitality, to develop our Zero Waste Cafe and create a template that other’s can replicate.

**Job Purpose**

Coordinate the work of volunteers and members to develop the SHRUB Cooperative’s emerging cafe space at 22 Bread Street, Edinburgh into a thriving, sustainable Zero Waste Cafe, engaging more customers with the Zero Waste lifestyle and increasing revenue generation to invest in SHRUB’s Zero Waste mission.

**Successful applicants must have experience and skills in the following areas:**

* Experience in cafe’s at supervisory level, minimum 2 years
* Managing teams of volunteers – experienced in how to delegate to and empower them
* Financial management – particularly within the context of appropriate gross margins for cafe sustainability
* Strong relationship building skills
* Passion for sustainability and the Zero Waste ethos and a vision for the impact of a Zero Waste cafe
* Strong communication and team working skills for a fast-paced working environment

**About the Zero Waste Hub**

A one stop shop for sustainable living! You can swap your preloved things in our Swapshop, enjoy some rescued food from our Food Sharing Hub, or just hang out and grab a tea or coffee from our Zero Waste Cafe.

**About the Cafe**

At the very heart of the Zero Waste Hub, our cafe is a fantastic welcoming space for existing members and people new to SHRUB. The cafe has been entirely volunteer led for the last 8 months. The Cafe Coordinator will be pivotal in supporting SHRUB to grow this space, empowering more people to make informed choices around living a zero waste lifestyle.

A crucial part of the role will be the development of the cafe as a Zero Waste enterprise, maximising its profitability to support the organisation as we move to operating independently as a social enterprise.

To apply please email by midnight **Sunday 29th September** to [jobs@shrubcoop.org](mailto:jobs@shrubcoop.org) attaching a single Word document comprising a maximum two A4 pages response with evidence of your knowledge, skills and experience which make you eligible for the job.

You may insert a maximum one page Covering Letter in front with a maximum two page CV pasted at the end of the same Word document as an appendix. The panel will shortlist on the basis of essential criteria with secondary weight given to desirable criteria.
