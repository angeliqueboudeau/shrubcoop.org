In order to do our part in ‘flattening the curve’ of COVID-19, and in accordance with government advice to halt all non-essential activity, SHRUB Coop will temporarily close all public activities until further notice.

With heavy hearts, this decision was made in a meeting between staff and trustees to ensure the safety of our volunteers and vulnerable members of the public.

We understand the difficulties this will cause to those who rely on our services, and to our volunteers who gain valuable social contact by taking part in our activities.

**What this means:**

* The Zero Waste Hub will be temporarily closed until further notice.
* The Wee Spoke Hub’s ‘Fix your own bike’ sessions will be suspended until further notice.
* Evening sewing sessions will be suspended until further notice.
* Food Sharing Edinburgh’s food collectors are advised to cease all redistribution activities.
* All workshops and events will be suspended until further notice and all customers who have already paid to take part in any classes will be refunded.
* Volunteer working group meetings will be conducted online.
* Over the coming weeks, you may see staff working in our shops and spaces undertaking various tasks, however, the shop spaces will be closed to the public.
* Valuable items have been removed from all sites and the keybox codes have all been changed.

Thank you for your understanding and we hope to resume our activities as soon as possible.

The next few weeks are going to be financially challenging for our charity. If you are able to support us through this difficult time, please consider donating at [shrubcoop.org](http://shrubcoop.org/?fbclid=IwAR1CcF-aiOUYPgehJMxfJ34tGuHowV8w9FM5aRJHkWiBcZtFV7OuozGyKp8)

Stay safe and take care,
