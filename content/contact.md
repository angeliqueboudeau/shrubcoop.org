#### Research enquiries and visits

We love to share what we do and how we work to inspire others to replicate our projects around the world. Answering research questions can require a lot of staff time. If you're a student with an essay deadline, please bear in mind that it could take us up to two weeks to get back to you.

We're very open to hosting research delegations and providing behind the scenes tours for other organisations. Simply get in touch at [hello@shrubcoop.org](mailto:hello@shrubcoop.org), and please try to contact us at least one month in advance of when you would like to visit.
