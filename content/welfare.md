## Bereavement

### **The Acorns Bereavement Support Service (ABSS)**

Provides bereavement support programmes for bereaved people in Edinburgh and the Lothians.

Each programme runs for six weeks and covers a range of topics relating to grief, loss and bereavement. ABSS offers four programmes throughout the year – one in the morning, one in the afternoon, and two in the evenings, in different locations in Edinburgh.

The programmes are aimed at those in the first year of loss but are open to anyone who feels they might benefit from the time shared with others in a group setting. Programmes take place in community settings such as libraries and community centres. The settings are intended to ensure the comfort of participants.

ABSS does not provide one-to-one counselling services, although there is some provision of information for those interested in counselling and other support services.

The programmes are designed to reassure those going through their journey of loss and restore confidence that there is a viable future for them. There is a group focus on normalising feelings surrounding loss – one participant described the programme as ‘a toolkit for self-help’.
