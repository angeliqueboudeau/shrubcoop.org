_Request for Proposals: Consultancy Task: “Project Fundraising Assistance” £2,800_

**Application closing date: 12noon on Monday 22 June 2020**

Are you a Freelance Fundraiser? Then SHRUB needs you!

We are currently looking for an experienced Freelance Fundraiser to join our SHRUB team for a limited time over the next two months. This will be to identify, develop and secure grant funding to support the future of SHRUB projects - in particular;

1\. the Food Sharing Edinburgh collection and distribution network,

2\. the Wee Spoke Hub - promoting DIY Cycle maintenance and active travel, and

3\. contributions towards other core costs.

This role entails scoping the opportunities and the needs of each of the three elements, identifying prospective funders and drafting the main elements of agreed funding bids.

The appointed fundraiser/organisation will draw on the support of and engage with the Fundraising task group in a way that enables them to subsequently continue this activity as a mixed staff/volunteer group.

We’re a Cooperative in Edinburgh working for a world without waste. We empower people to live a low waste and low carbon life. Become a member and swap your preloved things, enjoy some rescued food and be inspired by new ideas.

SHRUB is a member-led Cooperative with a large and enthusiastic community of volunteers who are essential to the delivery of our aims. As a part of the SHRUB team, fundraising work contributes to the strategic planning, decision-making, problem-solving and volunteer management which enables SHRUB as a whole to thrive.
