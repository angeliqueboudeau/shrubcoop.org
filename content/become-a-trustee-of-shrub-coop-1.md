Our Annual General Meeting is coming up and its time to select another group of trustees to guide the coop through 2022!

We invite applications from SHRUB members and others interested in contributing to the Coop’s development to join our group of Trustees. We are particularly looking for people with experience in the fields of **HR, Fundraising and Social Enterprise** but Trustees have a wide-ranging remit and there are opportunities for involvement across the work that SHRUB undertakes.

#### Why become a Trustee?

SHRUB is a cooperative with premises in central Edinburgh. Our Members contribute to decision-making processes. Trustees have special legal responsibilities and, in some circumstances may have to make sensitive or critical decisions on behalf of the Coop.

A Steering Group was established in May 2020 and now helps staff and working groups take the day-to-day decisions - meaning the Trustees’ role is mainly oversight and strategy.

Trustees learn about how our Social Enterprise runs and gain skills in leadership, problem - solving and innovation, strategic judgement and effective communication, to name a few.

Serving as a Trustee is an opportunity to learn about the governance of a not-for-profit organisation in a supportive environment, learning from more experienced Trustees and staff and the fresh perspective of newer Members alike.

#### Key Roles in Trustee team

* Convenor
* Secretary
* Treasurer
* Steering Group link
* HR and Welfare support 
* Fundraising support
* Risk and Compliance lead
* Monitoring and Evaluation support
* Governance and Policy lead
* Communications support
* Social Enterprise lead
* Strategy and Vision lead

#### What skills do I need?

Trustees have a wide-ranging remit with some people leading on particular aspects, some playing a more general role. We are looking for people with experience and skills in the specific areas listed above, but we also welcome applications from people who want to develop their experience or who have a more general interest in SHRUB. We particularly encourage applications from under-represented groups, including but not limited to: people of colour, trans people, non-binary people and women.

Trustees are responsible for overseeing development of the strategic framework within which day- to-day tasks are carried out by staffers and volunteers, and they help guide our long-term planning.

**What is the time commitment?**

As a voluntary Trustee, you will make some clear time commitments: to attend regular Trustee meetings (2 hours each month, currently on a Monday evening), and participate in staff support mechanisms.

Trustees will preferably participate in the work of a Working Group - attending meetings where possible and contributing to the direction and content of work.

As a cooperative, SHRUB Coop makes transparent, and effective decisions mostly by a Steering Group. Trustees delegate the day-to-day decisions to the Steering Group, comprising Trustees, Members (both Volunteer and Supporter Members) and Staff. The Steering Group meets every fortnight.

Time off can be arranged among Trustees, ensuring that there is a balance between Trustees’ wellbeing and SHRUB Coop functioning. If you cannot make a meeting you can let people know. There is a Welfare Working Group to support mental, physical and emotional wellbeing of volunteers and members if you need support in regulating your engagement.

**Who can apply?**

Anyone who supports the Vision and Mission of SHRUB Coop is invited to apply. We particularly encourage applications from under-represented groups, including but not limited to: people of colour, trans people, non-binary people, other members of the LGBT+ community, and women.
