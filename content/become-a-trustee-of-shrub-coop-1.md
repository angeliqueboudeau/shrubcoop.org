SHRUB Cooperative has registered as a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO). Our Constitution provides for the Board of Trustees to oversee the activities of SHRUB Cooperative and ensure we act in accordance with our purposes and the wishes of members of the Cooperative.

We invite applications from individuals interested in contributing to the Coop’s development to join the board of trustees as a treasurer. At this time we are particularly looking for professionals in the fields of Accountancy and Financial Management. **We particularly encourage applications from under-represented groups, including but not limited to: people of colour, trans people, non-binary people and women.**

SHRUB is a cooperative of Members who contribute to decision-making processes. Trustees have special legal responsibilities and, in some circumstances may have to make sensitive or critical decisions on behalf of the Coop.

#### Why become a Trustee?

Trustees learn about how our social enterprise runs and gain skills in leadership, problem-solving and innovation, strategic judgement and effective communication, to name a few.

Serving as a Trustee is an opportunity to learn about the governance of a not-for-profit organisation in a supportive environment, learning from more experienced Trustees and staff and the fresh perspective of newer Members alike.

#### Key Responsibilities

Trustees’ key **responsibilities** fall into the following areas:

* Vision mission and aims
* Strategy and objectives
* Culture and values
* Accountable leadership
* Control environment
* Governance processes
* Succession planning

Please have a read of the [Treasurer information pack](https://res.cloudinary.com/shrub-co-op/image/upload/v1580985682/shrubcoop.org/media/SHRUB_Treasurer_information_2020_fnjrvy.pdf "SHRUB_Treasurer_information_2020_fnjrvy.pdf") for more details.

#### What skills do I need?

Trustees have a wide-ranging remit with some people leading on particular aspects, some playing a more general role. **We are looking to recruit trustees with specialist skills in Accountancy or Financial Management but Trustees have a wide-ranging remit and there will be opportunities to be involved across the breadth of work that SHRUB undertakes.**

To flourish as a Trustee, you must be committed, passionate, flexible!

**What is the time commitment?**

As a voluntary Trustee, you will make some clear time commitments: to attend regular Trustee meetings (**2 hours, monthly on a monday evening**), and participate in our “Buddy and Steward” system to support staff and ensure good communication between staff and Trustees (**typically you will buddy one staff member and meet with them every 1-2 months**). Trustees will also have oversight of the work of their relevant Working Group (Finance) - attending meetings where possible and contributing to the direction and content of work.

As a cooperative, our community of members are invited to participate in Decision-making meetings once a month. At least one member of the Trustee board will be required to attend these meetings each month (**5-8pm one thursday a month on a rotating basis**)

There may also be opportunity outside of these times to contribute to new projects and discussions.

Time off can be arranged among Trustees, ensuring that there is a balance between Trustees’ wellbeing and SHRUB Coop functioning. There is an expectation that if you cannot make a meeting you let people know.

There is a Welfare Working Group to support mental, physical and emotional wellbeing of staff, volunteers and members if you need support in regulating your engagement.

**Who can apply?**

Anyone with Accountancy or Financial Management experience who supports the Vision and Mission of SHRUB Coop is invited to apply.

**We particularly encourage applications from under-represented groups, including but not limited to: people of colour, trans people, non-binary people, other members of the LGBT+ community, and women.**
