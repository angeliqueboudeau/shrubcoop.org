      <description>The Food Sharing Hub is Scotland’s first rescued food shop and exists to save surplus food from supermarkets from an unnecessary fate in the bin.
Simply come along to the Food Sharing Hub and sign up as a member of SHRUB Coop for as little as £1 a month. As a member you can fill one basket of food per day and pay as you feel.
How it works The Food Sharing Hub is working with Tesco, Co-op and Waitrose to collect food from 6 local supermarkets.</description>

      <description>We care about our SHRUB community, which is why every three months the Monitoring and Evaluation group asks to hear your concerns, ideas and suggestions through our Quarterly Member Survey. This time we only get 10 responses (we can do better than that next time!) but they were priceless.
1. There are clear positive behavioral changes from being a member. 40% of you reported you throw away less food.</description>
