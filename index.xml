      <title>3 things we learned from our quarterly membership survey!</title>

      <description>We care about our SHRUB community, which is why every three months the Monitoring and Evaluation group asks to hear your concerns, ideas and suggestions through our Quarterly Member Survey. This time we only get 10 responses (we can do better than that next time!) but they were priceless.
1. There are clear positive behavioral changes from being a member. 40% of you reported you throw away less food.</description>

      <title>Making sustainable fashion choices in Edinburgh</title>

      <description>“Out with the old and in with the new” is the mantra that crops up at this time of year, but this optimistic phrase is deceptively damaging to our world. Wardrobe revamps have become part of the regenerative symbol of spring, leaving a trail of poisonous dyes and discarded fabrics behind them.
The clothing industry has a huge carbon footprint – it takes around 8000 litres of water to produce just one pair of blue jeans.</description>

      <guid>https://www.shrubcoop.org/how-you-can-help-to-reduce-food-waste-in-edinburgh/</guid>
      <description>Did you know that almost a third of all food produced globally is thrown away? In Edinburgh alone, more than 27 tonnes of edible food are thrown out every week – that’s equivalent to 54,000 meals.
Some of this wasted food is thrown out by households and individuals: you can find advice on reducing your own food waste footprint from Love Food, Hate Waste among others.
Most of it, however, is thrown away by supermarkets who are cannot sell perfectly edible food after its ‘Best Before’ date.</description>
